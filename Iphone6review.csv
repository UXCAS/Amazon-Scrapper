The iPhone 6 was the perfect birthday gift,vanessa beltran,5,Oh my gosh!! The iPhone 6 was the perfect birthday gift!! I'm truly glad I got it because it really made my brothers day :) He's been wanting it for the longest!!The great thing about buying an unlocked phone is that you ...,john,5,The great thing about buying an unlocked phone is that you never have to worry about your contract again, and can switch carriers whenever you see a better deal elsewhere. Also using the phone in other countries is no issue!This is my 2nd iPhone , coming from an iPhone 5.I'm an Apple enthusiast so this was an obvious choice for me.It is fast opening and closing apps, websites, etc. but not a huge difference to make me suggest to hurry up and buy it.I only got an iPhone 6 because my daughter was in need of her first iPhone, so it made sense to give her my old iPhone 5.The screen response is perfect and the thumb print works 100% of the time and is really convenient to get into the phone.

Fast delivery and easy migration,LV Shopper "LennyVN",5,Exactly as advertised.  Fast delivery and quick migration from my iphone 5s. AA++ on all accounts. Love my new iPhone 6
Five Stars,rafael,5,Great phone.

Nice and big, lots of memory. Heats up fast,Nick Zoe,4,OK, the transfer between the old and new iphone wasn't as easy as I hopeed. Everything got across but an old email kept popping up as my primary itunes email. No idea why.  The phone itself is nice compared to the 5S but you will need to get used to holding or putting this larger phone in your pocket.  It's runs faster (I guess because it's new)  but it also heats up fast when downloading.  Battery life seems iffy and the phone is very warm to the touch. I need to figure out how to turn off certain Apps.  It's a worthwhile upgrade, especially from a 5 or 4s. If you have a 5s you can still hold off for a while.Five Stars,Alberto Arteaga,5,I love the iPhone
Five Stars,Nguyen P.,5,Great product!!
Love my new phone,Chicoteach,5,Love my new phone!  I had to go to Att&t to get it set up, because the SIM card from my iPhone 4 was too small.

If you like frustration you'll love this phone...,Dash Beardsley "Dash Beardsley",1,If you enjoy frustration you will LOVE this cellphone. I could start with the price which is way to high for this piece of #%^%!It doesn't work any better than the 5s  even though it has many more gigs! It still locks up and I clear it all the time to get it to work! Also I DL a song from ITunes which is paid for but STILL not in my song list! I called apple and got 4 hours of conversation and at the end you might think a small problem like that that would be solved??? No, I was told someone would call me back....I'm still waiting its been 2 weeks!!!! The camera is ok on this phone. Though it's very grainy. DO NOT WAISTE YOUR HARD EARNED $ ON THIS PHONE! I PAID FULL PRICE THINKING IT WAS REALLY GREAT! Don't be fooled by the hype. Most of my friends have switched from Iphone to Android and love them. I have not done this yet so I can't really from experience there. It's AMAZING to me this phone is worth a 5 star rating? Really? People are easily duped and go for ANYTHING that is on TV. IF providers and cellphone companies were honest they would give you a trial run instead of contracts! APPLE: GET IT TOGETHER!
Great phone.  But annoying that the battery life is just one day.,doctornewyork,4,Great phone.  Only complaint I have is that I had it charged 100% midday yesterday and the same time today it's running really low.  With all of the technology out there today, is it really that difficult to make a battery that lasts longer than a single day?  This review is not to be a comparison to other devices; i.e., I'm not saying I have any other device in mind that has a better battery life, but with regard to this product in isolation, you have to consciously think about having your charger on you if you'll be spending the night somewhere.  Always hoping to rely on someone else's cord isn't practical.But yeah, you won't be unhappy with this phone otherwise.  Great device.

The only problem also occurred in my previous purchase: ...,Eduardo José Campregher,4,The only problem also occurred in my previous purchase: my international card was not accepted in the first moment, just contacting customer support contact to go on.Five Stars,Yoyo Zhang,5,love it
Great deal,Loriel N. Johnson,5,Basically brand-new iPhone 6 64 GB for the price of the iPhone 6 16 GB. So far this phone works great it doesn't seem to have any problems item arrived in the condition it was described as and it came faster than it was supposed to. I will stay to check the warranty because the warranty he had listed was for phone support but the warranty to take the phone into the store to fix it does not expire until next year which is great.
Five Stars,Lisa Skubnik,5,very happy
Five Stars,MaybelKruspe,5,excelente

Five Stars,Mustafa Salman,5,It's nice I like it
Five Stars,JCNC,5,Excellent Product, Recommend.
very poor charge cord,Dave,3,The charge cord is very poor. It will likely go out on you in less than a year.
Still had warranty so Apple replaced.,D. Wick "worshipgirl",3,The unit I bought had a defective mic, but since it was still under Apple warranty, I took it to Apple and got a new one, Yay! If you get one, be sure it's still under Apple warranty.

Five Stars,karolina,5,wowSwitched from the 5S Gold and Couldn't Be Happier,Jamie,5,I debated for a long time if I should go ahead and upgrade from the 5s to the 6. After a week of owning it I'm so glad I did, but there are some things you need to consider before making the switch.First of all the biggest difference is the size of the phone. It actually feels lighter (it's thinner) but the screen is much larger. It took me a few days to get used to navigating the larger screen size with one hand, but it can be done. It still fits perfectly in my pocket or purse so that has been a non issue and I'm actually liking the larger screen size. It definitely enhances FaceTime.I also upgraded from 16gb on my 5s to 64gb on the 6 because I got sick of running out of room. If you make the choice to buy the 6, go with at least the 64gb of storage as it's not a huge price difference but a LOT more storage.It also synced right up with my iPad so if I'm reading or using my tab I can decline or answer calls and reply to texts from my tab as well as my phone.If you are getting gold or silver or whatever because you like the color of the phone, I suggest getting a Moshi case to match your phone. They have cases here on Amazon by Moshi that will protect your iPhone 6 without taking away from the color.Other than the screen size and the storage I upgraded, there's not a big difference between this and the 5s, but even then I do love the new design. Now if you're upgrading from just a 4 or regular 5, you'll love the Touch ID and other perks. If you're an iPhone lover, this one will not disappoint. If you use Android, this phone may be the one that converts you to the iPhone. I have two family members who were die hard Samsung fans and they are now changing to the iPhone 6 after seeing mine.
Very happy with purchase,Ms. L.,5,Great phone and price!
Four Stars,yongjunfeng,4,nice phone and verygood

Its an iPhone.,auswegian,4,Works like an iPhone should. Pretty hard to screw them up... well, pretty hard to screw them up more than apple is.The iphone was scratched!!!,Luis Ricardo Velho,1,My iphone came scratched on the back, box was damage. Frustrating

I don't know if the phone is new because the ...,Laël,3,I don't know if the phone is new because the box it came in had a different serial number listed. Also, no charger was provided with the phone.Functionally Unacceptable,Sandy Gardener "Sandy",2,I've owned a number of phones, but never an Iphone. All my relatives own Iphones though, and two of them have 6's. What I've noticed is that three primary functions of the Iphone 6's, phone, camera, and storage,  are of noticeably inferior quality compared to my old Nokia Lumia 520 ($40)and  my new dual sim unlocked Nokia 530 ($80).Phone: The call sound quality on the 6's is HORRIBLE compared to the Nokias, regardless of location. The primary purpose of a phone is to make calls, right? I often make my relatives hang up and call on their land lines. It's that bad. My wife is a flight attendant, and calls home from all over the US on the Nokia 520. The call quality is usually better than land line. I'm not exaggerating in either case.Photos: We go on vacation to Yosemite with the relatives. They're shooting photos with their 6's, us with our 520's, at the exact same times and locations. The photos get uploaded to Facebook. Across the board, the Iphone photo's are of substantially inferior quality to the Nokia photo's. I think this may have something to do with the thickness of the phones, and what that does to the lens design.  I've seen a number of articles on the Internet comparing and touting Iphone photo quality. All I know is what what I actually see myself.Storage: OK, this is no secret. There's no SD card slot on Iphones. You pay through the nose up front, or you're stuck. Our Nokia's have micro SD card slots just like other phones.I really don't get it. People literally pay ten times the money for a product that doesn't perform it's most basic functions satisfactorily. Yes, I know, there's all these wonderful apps available for the Iphone, and Iphones are so slim and sexy. I'll take the sound and photo quality of the Nokia.
Five Stars,Ricardo Godoy,5,Great purchase
Five Stars,Norberto Finol,5,Excellent
No power,Darrin,1,The phone would not turn on. After calling Apple and resetting the phone 4 times with Apple specialist the phone would not turn on. Charged it but signal would not turn on and screen never lite up. The back was chipped on the bottom right corner. Not the phone chipped just the phone was dented. Sorry about this review but it's true and I couldn't hold it in I had to throw the towel in.

This phone is pretty easy to use but,Becky LeBeau,2,This phone is pretty easy to use but...these are the issues I have with it. It doesn't have enough space. Can't have many pictures or apps. I have to keep deleting things or the camera doesn't work. Every time I upgrade it downloads another app that I don't want or need and I can't delete it. I don't have an apple watch! Why would I need the app? Also when I charge the phone in any car the radio gets fuzzy. It also uses data when I'm connected to WIFI! I'm a new mother of twins. I sometimes don't get out of the house for days at a time but I'm getting text messages saying "you have used 75% of your data". How? Verizon blames Apple. They say the phone uses data even if you are connected to WIFI. I only work the weekends! I thought 3 GB would be enough since I'm connected to WIFI 5 out of 7 days. guess not!Love my new iPhone,Darren Bernard Moore,5,Love my new iPhone!! Had a note 3 before this and decided it was time to go back to apple and I think I'm sticking with Apple.

Brand New Phone and Works Great (European charger though in the USA),Bradley Spicer,4,Brand new phone arrived in 1 day in a sealed box. Works great and I'm happy. The only negative is that I received a European charger. I live in the United States. No biggie, the USB cable is the same and I can use the wall plug unit from my Ipad.

Completely disapointed,carlos henrique barros,1,Everything about the phone seemed fine at first inspection the exterior was brand new. However, the audio function was a problem from the first call I made. It was impossible to hear the caller nor could I speak to the caller. This was true in the both iPhone and speaker function. Because of the audio issue, the phone is unable to record voice messages or shoot videos with any audio recorded. Additionally, the iPhone 6 has also shut down on its own several times without any prompting. You can imagine my frustration when I'm unable to hear or speak to my friends, family and business associates.I've tried to reboot/restart the iPhone a few times. I've also reset and restored the phone and it doesn't seem to remedy the situation.love it,kekecakes,5,Delivery was fast they said like new and it was seller even went out of their way to fulfil a rather demanding request no problems with my purchase very satisfied
perfect condition, no scratch or bumps,jose martinez,5,product arrived in perfect condition, i was in its sealed plastic pack and had no scratch or bumps on it. worked perfectly when tested. only "complain" that i could have about it is that i was disappointed to see that it didn't arrive in a amazon box like all my previous purchases. other than that everything was perfect!

Iphone review,Johnby,4,The iPhone 6 works perfectly well. I usually get androids but I wanted to try something new. The only downside is the battery life other than that it is really good. Another thing I would recommend getting more memory if you like to have music a lot of pictures and a lot of videos. I seem to always have too much memory in the storage. The iPhone 6 is really good because of the simplicity unlike android. If you want a simple easy to use phone that is quite stylish I would get this phone. The camera is really good as well and apple provides many good apps.
Cheers!,Dan,5,The package arrived  as advertised.  I am satisfied with the  vendor.

Finally a size that is arthritis friendly...,Pelican Freak,5,I am loving this phone - I am coming to it from an iPhone 5s and several other older versions of the iPhone before it. The previous models were a bit uncomfortable - I am severely arthritic and lately it's gotten into my hands. This one is much more comfortable to hold and manipulate.Of course it's really pretty too which doesn't hurt anything. Is sturdy, I am forever dropping this thing / having it fall, etc and I do not have it in an Otterbox, but just a basic, clear case so I can admire it's beauty.  Super easy to use like all iOS devices.Gorgeous picture with the retina display that cannot be found on smaller devices , yet doesnt need bigger than this. A perfect size. I wouldn't want to go any bigger, but smaller was just getting painful.

GPS drains about 10% of battery per hour,MK,1,Decent phone, but stay away from it if you intend to travel.1) The GPS app is a power hog. Drains about 10% of battery/hr2) Does not work (yes, even though it is marked as unlocked) in India. I tried airtel, vodafone and few other simmsAs a general advice : buy directly from Apple/Amazon as opposed to a third party seller.

Euro plug power adapter, not USA!,Lawrence C.,2,Actually, the phone itself is perfect and worthy of 5 stars. Unlocked and ready to go. In fact, I'm happy because I was able to just pop my AT&T SIM card in and it worked! Before buying the phone, I stopped in at my local AT&T store to ask if I would have a problem using an unlocked iPhone with my SIM. They said no, but led me to believe I would have to take the phone in to be activated. I don't know why they said that.I'm giving 2 stars because the power adapter plug in the box is European type, and I don't see anywhere in the description that it is a non USA power adapter. It's not a problem for me as I travel to Europe often and would need to use a plug adapter anyway. But, for those who absolutely need a USA power adapter, beware!

This version doesn't work with many providers.,JA,2,Careful! Read the description carefully. Canadian version of "unlocked" doesn't work with many U.S. Providers. The whole reason to spend more for unlocked is to switch providers at will.

Perfect and on time,Flavia,5,We received the product on time and it was impecable, we have not activated it yet but I can asume it it unlocked as the description specified when I bought it.Great phone, with moderate battery life, and great usability.,Ali Ashraf,4,Apple UI is hard to beat as far as ease of use, and simplicity. The phone does everything I'd like it to. Battery life is not the greatest. Screen size was something of a worry for me, since I thought that the iPhone 5/5s screen size was perfect for me. I got used to it real quick, and now it doesn't bother me at all.

Five Stars,Isamar Sivira,5,ExcelenteSo Sorely dissappointed with Apple, I can't even Say...,Jake,1,After finally throwing-in the Towel on Android I was very excited to get my new iPhone 6. I was tired of the horrific battery length in my Samsung SII's and SIII's (mainly due to dozens of Apps running in the background without your Permission.) Also, almost impossibility of accessing any of your files on the device without a Third-Party App. Also, the frightening permissions that you must agree to in order to Install anything. Also, the finickyness of Android to want to install to any device if it doesn't "think" that it may be compatible, or the frustration in installing to more than one device, or to a non-standard, or off-brand Android device. Mostly to the poor batterySo, I was so excited to try out my new iPhone 6. But, the Love-Affair lasted only less than a day, and started dwindling quickly, after day 1. The battery is Excellent, when compared to the previous Android versions. It charges relatively quickly, and stays charged. I found Facetime to be a nice Bonus that I wasn't expecting. That's where the good part ends. You will despise the nightmarishly small buttons, such as the "Send" button, if you are converting-over from any other Phone. The Permissions may possibly be far Worse than even Androids' scary permissions...you have to put all your Credit Card # on file, and they even warn you that this is dangerous, and you have to use Safety features that (supposedly) safeguard your Credit Card # and Personally Identifiable Information...but, it would be better if you didn't have to provide this information in the First Place. It doesn't have the same problem as the Android, whereas if you've been put on hold for two hours, and suddenly your call is connected you're keypad would time-out and you would be S.O.L. ("outta-luck"), and have to call back, and wait on hold for another couple of hours. That was exceptionally-annoying. Thanks for nothing Android. The file management is only slightly better than Android's pathetic file-management system (or, complete & total Lack Thereof.) I'm not entirely sure how to use all of the 64 Gb of Memory on this Apple, unless, all you do is take pictures and nothing else.In addition to Apple iPhones' god-awfully Tiny, Puny pathetic buttons that unless you're a petite third-grade girl you will be incredibly frustrated with. Let's hope you don't have Fat Fingers, or you're Completely outta-luck with Apple, Sorry. If you ever try to cut-and-paste a combination of numbers and letters or symbols, such as a Password for example, from a Text file you will drive yourself quite literally insane and will have to have yourself committed. In fact, you will NEVER be able to copy-over that symbols/letters/numbers from a Text file. It. just. isn't. possible. Missing are many of the function-Keys that you may have been accustomed-to, on your Android. The camera is Stellar, and you can do some cool functions with your Photos. It seems to tell you what "it" thinks you want for all your buttons, at the bottom, and, as far as I know, this is not customizable. It also tells you what it wants to be on your desktop Screen, and dumps a bunch of Random icons there, for your deleting pleasure. The most embarrassing thing about the iPhone, is if you press on a person's name, it will Automatically CALL them, even if it's 1 or 2 in the morning, and all you wanted to do, was Edit the details. Beware of This!!! until you get used to Apples' Style of telling you what to do, or what It thinks You want to do!! Incorrectly, as it is. The requirements of installing the bloatware known as iTunes to your Computer is a minor annoyance. A HUGE problem is that apple iPhones' will Continuously nag you to install or Update apps, even if you don't want to. It's all-or-nothing, apparently, with Apple. Sucks, I know.... All you want to do is use your phone, and you have to keep clicking these annoyances, to get rid of them. Sure, you can turn the whole thing off, but you may not necessarily want to do That, either. So, you are forced to compromise, if you want to own an Apple.The most insanely-Stupid and beyond frustration thing about the Apple is it is the ONLY phone in our Nation's history to not allow speed-dial programming of your number keys. Not something you would AT ALL expect from a phone, certainly one that costs Several hundred dollars.Even the Cheapest phone I can possibly find, that was made-and-assembled in China, allows for programming of the number keys!!!! How Embarrassing this must be for Apple! If I was on the board-of-directors, I would be Truly Ashamed. Sure they have a couple work-around's, including some weird Circles, placed ALL THE way at the top of the Screen. These oddly-place round circles are devoid of any Color, and have people's full Intitials creepily put on them, rather than any kind of picture icon or colorful symbol that you would expect from any company in the Twenty-First Century. This oddly-insisted-upon quirk puts Apple technology WAY back past cheap Chinese phones that are decades old. I thought that, naturally, a Several-hundred dollar phone would have such features as a programmable number keypad as Standard. But, unfortunately, if you invest in this Pricey technology, you will find out this is NOT the case, at least not with Apple.So, if you want to pay several hundred dollars for a Prehistoric phone then Apple is for you.

Five Stars,Kyle B.,5,Perfect phone. Came unlocked as advertised. Put in my Cricket SIM card without any problems.New iPhone, old iPhone problems,R Frost.,1,New iPhone old iPhone problems,  I read reviews on Amazon and other shopping sites all the time, sometimes they help me in my buying decisions, and sometimes they don't,  I do hope this will help you make your buying decision.  I'll try to make this short and sweet,  this iPhone has an extraordinarily  then case, it bends easily just like the 6+, the camera protrudes from the case, you don't think of this being a problem until you set the phone down and try to play a game or text somebody,  The wobbling of the phone is very annoying, being an electrician I pay a great amount of attention to detail, especially in the charging system, or electrical cords, I love the iPhones lightning cord technology it's outstanding, however these phones cost $800 and up,  and the cord you receive is extremely short, and poorly made, The screen technology falls short in comparison to a lot of the newer technology out there, Samsung, LG,  and others,  they need to understand what true high-definition really means. The battery life in these phones are actually going downhill, as far as this area is concerned, the battery life on the newer generation  iPhones are getting worse not better, that is a fact, the batteries become completely  useless  after 8 to 9 months of use, and then are extraordinarily expensive to replace, if you're able to do so at all, here is the biggest issue, and let me remind you once again these phones start at $800,  when you upgraded your iOS operating system, it always slows down your phone, and eventually making the phone completely obsolete, you can tell the usual signs, the phone crashes and goes back to the homepage, lots of chop when you surf the Internet, and you have to clear your memory and cookies constantly,  I work on iMac computers all day long, however i'm at the point now that I'd rather not use an iOS driven device,  just so you understand these are genuine concerns, they're making the phone look very pretty,  however do they still have the short cord after all these years, why yes they do,  understand this has been there largest consumer complaint, that and the fact that these phones will not hold onto a Wi-Fi signal, this has been a huge problem and still exist today in nearly all of their models,  before making a  purchase, I would highly recommend you background the phone on the Internet,  and find out what's really going on with these devices,  I love Apple products, and I thought Steve Jobs was truly a genius  however, Mr. Cook has  most certainly drop the ball.

The screen breaks so easily.,f.gibbs2989,3,I’ve gone through my fair share of iphones. I used to have the 3g, 4g, and 5.  Now I have moved onto the 6 and I dropped it one time and bam the screen shattered. I dropped all my other iphones from higher levels onto hard floors and they would never shatter, but the 6 did. I feel as though apple should be making their phones built to last. If I have to pay that much money for a phone I would expect it to at least have some kind of resilience to breaking when it’s dropped. I know they offer a warranty, but that is even more money tacked onto the $700 I am already paying. To me something selling for such a high price should be more impressive and durable.
Four Stars,Joseph Okechukwu,4,Phone is wider than I had expected.
a BAD PHONE with lots of bells and whistles but still a lousy phone,Ted K "duraflex",1,It's a LOUSY PHONE.It may have a beautiful display and all kinds of connectivity and bells and whistles - BUT as a PHONE - it's just bad - really bad.I have worked with many realtors who use these iphones and they all sound like crap.  When possible, I usually wind up asking them to call me back FROM a land line. When they do, I can hear them perfectly whether I am on my Motorola flip phone, my wife's cheapo Samsung cell phone or our hard-wired ATT land line.Really, it may be a really expensive hand held computer that does all kinds of tricks, but as phone to TALK to other people, it cannot even match the quality of cell phones I had 15 years ago.

Absolutely love this phone but there is one drawback...,Gillian Herrle,4,Ok, in general I am obsessed with the design of this phone. When the iPhone 6 came out, we all thought the size was a little bit big - but I absolutely love having a larger screen! It makes watching videos, using Instagram and editing photos SO much more enjoyable! My one drawback to this phone, which is pretty major in my opinion, is how the camera lens protrudes from the back of the phone. Basically, without a case, your phone is sitting right on the camera when it is set down. This is ridiculous to me. It took me a few weeks to decide on which case I wanted to purchase for my iPhone 6 and by the time I decided on the Lifeproof case, my camera had cracked. Overall I am in love with my iPhone 6; I absolutely love the new design and adore the gold color which is super classy and beautiful. However, Apple really dropped the bomb by not protecting the lens more on a $1000 phone. I'm bummed by the fact that I have this amazing phone that now has a cracked camera.

I went to Apple and they said it is under warranty and they replaced the whole front screen and cover!!! What kind of Brand New cellphone is that....Bad experience from Amazon buyers

Happy Birthday to me!,Randy Ivie,5,I'll pay the price upfront anyday to not have to budget for it for years in the future. This way I can sell it if I want, trade it, lend it to my wife, and on and on. Freedom has a price. =)With that said, it is by far the best iPhone and best phone on the market. We've been waiting for a larger screen to keep up with technology and this phone does all that and more. Battery life is good. If I were to go back I'd get the 64GB just for future proofing, but honestly, since I can sell it whenever I like, I didn't think it would matter much. Also got a Spigen case for it from day one to help keep its value.

Best phone available in 2015!,Devon Miller,5,This phone, is by far the best phone I have ever had! I don't know where to begin, this iPhone is fantastic! TouchID makes everything easier, the camera is beautiful, this is a fast phone! I have used previous iPhone's but this is definitely the best of them yet! Came brand new sealed in the box, setup was painless. iOS 8.3 has a very user friendly interface, and it is a fast OS for a mobile device at that. The carrier I chose is Straight Talk. I put my SIM card in, called the number on my SIM activation kit, and was ready to go within 5 minutes! No additional effort was required on my part. Having iCloud made restoring all of my settings a breeze, and, if my phone ever breaks, I won't lose any data since iCloud makes a backup every time the phone is plugged in and connected to wifi! The battery on this is amazing! When it arrived, it was at 80%. I drained it down to 2% and plugged it in until 100% for the first charge. I have not charged it since, besides listening to music through USB in my car when driving, and it's been almost a week.The build of this phone is beautiful. I bought a waterproof case to keep it that way. I strongly recommend this phone if you like a user friendly, fast, reliable device that won't have a dead battery in a year like most other phones do.

in love with my iPhone 6 :),Kimberly Enriquez,5,I have this same iPhone in 128 GB and I'm not even half with filling it up yet!Seriously love this iphone! I've had an iPhone pretty much since ever, I started with an android back in 2010 (my first phone and I was about 18 years old) but it was a piece of poop so I decided to buy an iPhone 4 in 2011, and I've been in love with it since then! But in 2013 I was like "oh what the heck, why not make a change? I'll just get an android" so I (was indeed stupid) traded my iPhone 4s at the time, with a galaxy s3 and boy did I regret it. It lagged and it was the worst camera I've seen! Now I understand that since it was 2 years ago, technology has become better but I still don't trust androids at all! I'm scared they'll let me down. And for s 2 year contract I don't wanna waste money. I love iPhones :) they're classic, beautiful and just amazing quality! #teamapple

Five Stars,Anjali Gupta,5,Awesome phone

my thoughts on iphone,Corinne Sefcik,4,I wasnt sure about buying the iphone because for one, its the expensive, and two, andriod phones have come a long way in features and apps. Its sometimes extremely hard to compare these phones, when it comes to battery life, pixel density, screen size and build quality. I used [...] to help me compare, and I would recommend checking this out if you are serious about buying an iphone or one of the samsung galaxy phones. The great thing about buying an unlocked phone is that you never have to worry about your contract again, and can switch carriers whenever you see a better deal elsewhere. Also using the phone in other countries is no issue!I hope this helps.5 stars, good.,alfonso ontiveros,5,good phone, love it. Slim, stylish. functional.

Great deal, very good device,Rodrigo,5,Great deal, very good device, the seller was also of a big help, shipping it overnight as I was going for a trip on the day after!The iPhone 6 takes the best of what works for apple and brings it to ...,Jess Harris,5,Just as advertised. No problems at all. The iPhone 6 takes the best of what works for apple and brings it to a form factor that the masses want. Once you get used to the larger size, it's a great device. However, previous iPhone users beware: the size does take time to get used to. It's a larger device that makes one handed use more difficult.

Nothing Innovative Here Folks, BUT...,Timbo Slice "Tim",5,I LOVE THIS PHONE!So Ill break it down for you guys. Im not the biggest Apple fan in the world. I do not own anything other than an iPhone. But I have been buying iPhones for 6 plus years (no pun intended). I've been a huge fan of the super user friendly iOS that they have on them. The phones have a lot of limitations. But for a phone, I would never complain. I will say the same thing I tell everyone who asks about iPhones and iPads and what have you, "The iPhone is a great phone, but if you want a tablet, go android." The android tablets defeat the iPad in every way I could possible imagine. Yet, I digress.Now onto the iPhone 6 itself. I purchased the space grey model with the 128gb hard drive. The very first thing I noticed with this phone was the screen. I wont go into the specifics of pixel density. The iPhone 6 does not have the highest. But the particular screen they used is what is called 5k (basically 4k but Apples name for it) and it just looks beautiful. The clarity it boasts puts not only previous iPhones, but other past phones to shame. Like it should right? Its a brand new phone. It should be a lot more innovative than any phone that came before it, right? Well, my answer to that is no, it doesnt. Apple took what we loved of the iPhone and just reused it in this phone. They improved a lot of the phones features, but once again, there is nothing that this phone offers that you could not find in other phones on the market today. But Im still loyal to the iPhone for its incredibly easy to use interface.Now the next thing that blew my mind with this phone is the camera and video recorder. I go to concerts a lot. And I love getting pictures of the bands while they are in action. I also love getting videos of my favorite songs so I can relieve those moments. Ive recorded a lot of videos with previous phones and the audio/video quality is just terrible. Until I got this phone. The camera has a new software added to it to allow it to keep focused much better than the previous phones. The same software is used in one of the newer Samsung phones as well, so once again, nothing new to the table. So when me and my friend are at a Blue Oyster Cult concert, we decided to see who's phone recorded better audio/video. He was using the Samsung Galaxy 5. His video was the same if not slightly better than mine. He could also zoom in much closer than I was able too. However, the audio on my videos kicked his phones butt up and down that stage. Anytime the drums would, be it bass pedal or cymbal, his phones audio would just clip. Meanwhile, my iPhone takes those louder noises in stride and produced the best video I've ever managed to record on a phone. Also, just to add a bit more, there was a short film shot entirely with an iPhone 6. Its a FPS romance film about two lovers living their day to day life in New York I do believe. I watched the trailer they had on Youtube for it a while back and the quality was really good. So kudos iPhone for filming a movie!They added some new apps to the iPhone when this phone came out. Though I do believe you can get those apps on the previous incarnations of the iPhone. The biggest thing Apple has been bragging about however is Apple Pay. Unlucky for me, I live in a smaller city that hasnt quite adapted to these "new fangled ways" of getting into dept, I mean shopping. So I havent gotten to try Apple Pay. Maybe one day soon though.So all in all guys, I love my iPhone 6. This phone however does not offer something that you couldnt find in another phone, except maybe the stupid high amount of memory you can get now. And for someone like me who loves having an easy to use interface and a bunch of memory (my phone is my iPod. Its just more convenient) then this phone would be a damn good choice. Apple could have put more features and made the phone much more unique, but I was happy with the changes they've made since the iPhone 5 and I just hope the iPhone 7 will give us features on our phones we never knew possible. Happy shopping fellows.

A disappointment,John M.,3,I upgraded from a Samsung SIII to the iPhone 6.  I have found pluses and minuses with the iPhone, but I have been really disappointed with the basic functionality of the phone -- things that one would expect to be figured out after six iterations of the phone.First is that my phone, every now and again, shuts down for no apparent reason.  Plenty of battery power, but I pull out the phone and find out that it is off.  How many calls have I missed?  I find myself hauling the thing out every hour or so just to see if it's working.  (Apple's customer service has been useless about this.)Email is amazingly primitive.  The rest of the world figured out how to attach a file in 1985.  Apple is still working on it.The phone has all kinds of little tricks and gadgets on it, which are great, but they missed on the big things.

Great phone,reluctant reviewer,5,Love the phone. I was considering the Samsung Galaxy Note 6, but I didn't buy it because I will be using it internationally and the Samsung international version wouldn't work 4g in the U.S. According to reviews. I have yet to use the iPhone 6 overseas.
Five Stars,maria,5,everything perfect!

good company, good deal and the most important thing ...,Saad Alzibali,5,good company , good deal and the most important thing is the shipment delivered was extremely excellent .ANDROID PHONES ARE BETTER FOR BUSINESS and BETER FOR BRANDING,Stacy K.,2,OK, please tell me is I'm wrong on this, but one month ago, I switched from a Android (it was old, a Galaxy S3 with 16 GB of memory, and I was switching cell phone companies anyway) to the iPhone 6 64GB phone (not the "plus version" - too big for my needs).  I AM SWITCHING BACK to an ANDROID.  I wanted to be fair and give it 30 days, which I think should be enough time to test a lot of the basic features I would use every day.  I have been on this iPhone 6 10-12 hours a day for the past 30 days Emailing, texting, calling, Internet searching, photo-taking, etc.  My conclusion: for a business owner, the Android is MUCH better for the following reasons (and these are only the ones I've discovered in the past 30 days):1. On the Android, I was able to forward to my assistant, via text, any voicemails I didn't need to handle and text her a message saying "Could you please handle this?".  You can’t do this on the iPhone 6.  You can't even do it via Email unless you download an app.  After downloading this app and taking over an hour to set it up, I discovered that, when calling other people, the caller ID now does not show MY name or MY phone number.  It shows some other phone #, which may cause a client not to answer my call.  Also, building a brand is important to a business, and this caller ID issue is not good for branding.  So, I either have to live without forwarding voicemail messages (which is a huge time saver!!) or keep it and have some random phone number and name show up when I call others.  In the end, the functionality should just BE THERE in the first place and be easy to figure out like it was on the Droid.2. You cannot set up a default signature for a text.  In other words, with each text, on the Android, my message was followed by my name and my website.  Again - a great branding thing because my friends, family and business associates are reminded of what I do without me being in their face about it, but also, if a new client or prospect doesn’t have my contact info/phone number saved into their phone yet, this lets them know who is texting them and they might respond more quickly.  In addition, they might also consider visiting my website after seeing my default signature (what business doesn't want that?!).  I found out that you can set up a shortcut on the iPhone to MANUALLY add it at the end of each text, but I can’t remember to do it because I am BUSY and I don't think I should have to remember to do it.  It should just BE there.  Therefore, this is brand identity that I have lost with the iPhone.3. You cannot search the Internet when you're on an iPhone 6.  You CAN do this on the Droid.  I OFTEN search for things on the Internet while on the phone when a client has a question or one of my team members calls me and needs something.4. The iPhone 6 camera is NOT very good.  Photos are a core part of my business (and also my personal life) and the clarity of the photos on the iPhone 6 are not as good as my OLD Droid.  I thought maybe I could change the default size on the camera menu to a larger size (as you can do on the Droid) to improve the quality, but no iPhone user has been able to tell me how and I can't find it on the menus or the Internet.  To explain, when I take a photo and then zoom in on the photo, it is blurry.  Yes, BLURRY.  I previously had a Galaxy S3 (a pretty "old" phone) and you could zoom in on any object and the clarity would be fantastic when you zoomed in on the captured image.  As an example, when letters were too tiny on labels, I used to use the camera on that S3 phone to take a photo of the label and then I would zoom in I would be able to read it.  Can't do this with the iPhone 6.  With photos of people, it's the same thing.  What's up with this?  The other reviews I've read show that its clarity is not as good.  I really wish I'd done my research before just believing all the iPhone fans out there.  Apparently, they don’t know what they don’t have.5. The texting program is not intuitive.  On the Droid, it was very smart and intuitive.  It got used to words you used a lot and would automatically bring them up as default options and even correct your grammar very well.  The iPhone does not do this, even if I've typed the same word 200 times in 30 days (like my daughter's name, for instance).  The talk-to-text is also less accurate.  The Droid gets more and more accurate as it learns your speech patterns and pronunciations.  Also, when correcting my texts, tapping and holding where the incorrect spelling is and dragging it is much less efficient and requires more accuracy on the iPhone and also sometimes takes 3-4 attempts to even get it to recognize where I'm tapping.  It takes me 3x as long to type a text.  Not good in my business.  Also, the swipe-texting feature is delivered with the Droid – and I love this feature.  When I can’t voice-to-text because I’m in a quiet place, it helps me text more quickly that tapping the letters on the keyboard.  You apparently have to download the swipe-texting function for the iPhone  but I'm not even going to bother since I've wasted too much time trying to configure the phone and adapt to IT versus IT adapting to MY needs.  It's just too frustrating and time-consuming to download apps to fix things that should be there by default like the Droid.6. Working the iPhone 6 with one hand is much more difficult due to where the menu selections are.  It was much easier to use the Droid when only having one hand free.I was willing to cough up the exorbitant cost of the iPhone if it would save me time and if it was a much better experience, since I don't have a lot of time at this stage of my business and in many cases, “you get what you pay for”.  If I'm paying almost $800 for a phone (I don’t like contracts), I expect the same or better than the Droid, as all "die hard" iPhone users say it is.  What I am finding is that most iPhone users have only ever BEEN iPhone users and that they don't know what functionality they're not getting because they have always had an iPhone.  I wanted to enter into it with an open mind and judge it based on my experience and my needs.  Yes, there are probably things about the iPhone that are better than a Droid (not sure what yet), but for a business person whose priority is BRANDING, and considering the value for the money, this phone is definitely not for me.Again - PLEASE feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but after hours of searching, I have given up on finding answers to these issues.  I need to get back to building and BRANDING my business now...  I'm researching Android phone options now, but reviews and articles are pointing to the new Galaxy S6 or the Galaxy  Note 4 as the best phones for BUSINESS.  I don't care about the battery not being removable on the Galaxy S6 or that there is no Micro SD card slot (I'm buying a 64 GB version).  My fingers are crossed that I can get back on track with my business very soon after I switch back.

Satan Approved,Barnabus,5,So this was very effective in helping me communicate and get closer to my lord and savior, Satan. Now, before this, I had some sort of Android device. And while I was still able to communicate, the connection just was not as clear and pristine, and I didn't feel the emotional bond that I feel now. Not only is this a great device for communicating verbally, but it really does help you connect with those who are not quite human on a deeper level. He was able to use me as a vessel, getting in and out of my body in a cleaner and quicker manner through the iPhone, that other smart phones really just can't offer.
Oh Thank God for Apple!,David Batterson "David Batterson",5,Thank god for the iPhone! My first iPhone was the 4S and I had it for a couple of years. I never had one single problem with it. Then I ended up getting the Galaxy Note II when it first hit the market. It was like climbing out of a Bentley and getting into a Volkswagen.The fluidity of the overall function of the iPhone from navigating anywhere within the phone as well as its speed cannot be matched. When I went Android I lost all of that. True Apple lovers know what I'm talking about. The speed and fluidity of Apple products can't be touched! I was floored.After 3 years of lugging around a phone I never cared to even really learn how to use, I got the iPhone 6 and never looked back. As a matter of fact, the only bad thing I can say about this phone is that I wanted black and ended up with a gray one. But that really doesn't matter!

Five Stars,Jose A. Bueno,5,It is the best.An Amazing Smart Phone. The best!!!,Filmorama "Filmorama",5,I LOVE this phone. It loads data quickly and everything works how it should. The screen size was the main reason why I wanted to upgrade - the other iPhone screens always seemed too small. (I didn't go for the 6 PLUS because I wanted the phone to comfortably fit in all my pockets, which this does.) I'm not someone who needs the highest HD resolution screen, so if that's an issue for you then I recommend checking out the iPhone 6 in a store so you can make sure the screen meets your needs.Otherwise, everything about this phone is awesome. I use Siri a lot to get directions and find the maps feature extremely helpful. If I take a wrong turn, it recalculates directions quickly. This is an impressive feature. The thumb print Touch ID is beyond helpful. I wasn't sure about using it at first, but now I can't imagine punching in the code each time - what a hassle that was! Also, I watch a lot of videos on my phone using my home wifi (no data use that way) and this phone streams video perfectly. It never even gets stuck when the video goes to commercials. this was sometimes a problem with other products.I'd like to add one little tip: Lower your brightness setting (just ask Siri to do it if you're lazy!). This will extend your battery life, and it's a little easier on the eyes, although I should add that the battery is very good. Have fun and enjoy your phone!
THE PHONES ARE NOT UNLOCKED,jasmine suarez,1,THIS IS NOT AN UNLOCKED IPHONE 6. THE PHONE IS LOCKED TO VERIZON. I suggest calling Apple to verify the IMEI to confirm where the phone is locked to because you will not be able to use it without it being unlocked to the original carrier first!

I LIST THE IMPROVED FEATURES OVER THE 5.,Harkanwar Anand,4,I don't agree with critics who say Apple hasn't made significant improvements from the iPhone 5. Everyone who is reading this review has probably owned an iPhone 5 and some own even older models. There are a few improvements since say the iPhone 5 so I wanted to help the audience that has the iPhone 5 (not saying I exclude others)Here are the major improvements since the iPhone 5,a) CAMERA - My word, there is more detail, almost takes a photo in the worst ever lit room, very sharp, excellent photos, the macro could be a little better but you can download several applications to counter the macro recognition system. Older iPhone 5 now looks grainy.b) CALL QUALITY - Much louder on speaker, better earphone speaker than before. The iPhone 5 was very good but when I hold it right next to the iPhone 6, the difference is substantial.c) SPEAKER - Much louder, clearer, still wouldn't replace my JBL bluetooth but still good enough. Much clearer whether on phone call or while playing music. You almost never ever keep it on 100% volume cause its rudely loud otherwise. I have compared this with my wife's HTC one m8 and it is almost as loud as the boom speaker but we all know HTC has the best speaker.d) BUILD QUALITY - For the first month, I kind of regretted getting the 6 because it is so much bigger and the one handed operation was useless. I almost never use reachability. The 6 is much more slippery than the iPhone 5 and using without a case is not even an option. So I would say despite the changes, being lighter, i miss the 5's ease of use and builde) TOUCH ID - DOn't think it makes a difference? You are wrong. It is convenient if not flawless in execution.f) Display - The brightness and pixel density has improved which ideally means you will find watching videos much better. Owing to a better graphics procesor the iPhone 6 is better for reading, viewing videos.g) iOS 8 is definitely optimised for iPhone 6. I'm sorry but the Iphone 5 was running the iOS 8 really slow. I really hated it. I was almost strong armed into purchasing the iPhone 6 but overall I can't say I am not satisfied.Thank God for the 128GB. I no longer have to worry about keeping Pearl Jam's discography on my iPhone.h) OTHERS - It can charge faster if you use the iPad Air adapter, the battery life is much much better and lasts me about 18 hours which is satisfactory, I read this more often for reading because iBooks is so much fun on this, Apple Pay doesnt work where I live (we avoid using card and love CASH despite it being slimy)

Coming Back to Apple,Mz. Medusa,5,I left the iPhone community because I wanted a bigger screen and was hooked by some of the flashy tech offered by the Android market.  I loved my S4, proudly showed it off.  Almost 6 months to the day of purchase, the phone started acting strangely.  It would reboot itself up to 17 times a day.  It would close apps randomly and open other apps.  The battery stopped holding a charge.  The micro USB port broke.  I started missing my iPhone because it simply worked, every time.  The iPhone 6 came out and it includes all the features I left Apple for.  I am so happy to be back.  I have the huge screen, it works every time and I have the best customer service available when I have any questions or issues.

The perspective from switching to iphone from android,Amircat1,5,So I made the switch from using Android to the iPhone back in October, and I've been using the iPhone 6 for the past few months now and can give a detailed review on what it's like to switch over. Before this switch, I've used the Samsung Galaxy S2 (first smartphone ever!) and also the Nexus 4. Since I'm a tech enthusiast, I'm well versed and have played around with many other Android devices, including all the big names, Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 and M7, One Plus One, and so on. Here are my thoughts:Things that the iPhone does really well (both hardware and software-wise):1. Camera. The behind the scene software for digitally capturing an image is definitely the strongest sell for the iPhone. Other than the S5 and Note 4, no smartphone really comes close to having the same kind of image quality (no matter the megapixels) compared to the iPhone. This was one of the reasons for me to switch over since I've started to dabble with photography and wanted a really good camera in my smartphone. (Side note, if you read a lot of tech blogs, there is a notion that in the near future our smartphones won't accurately describe our devices anymore since making a phone call is probably one of the least commonly used features on a smartphone when you look at any average user. Cameras, social media, emails all take a higher usage rate than making a call... really interesting, but anyway, back to the review).2. Reliability. There have been maybe 2 or 3 times when my phone crashed and would have to be restarted, mostly due to playing some game that was not written very well for the iOS devices. On Android devices, I've experienced a lot more crashes, and that may be due to the fact that so many apps haven't figured out the best way to optimize the app for each individual phone due to the fragmentation problems or something else. Either way, I feel like the iOS environment and hardware is more reliable in my everyday use.3. Fingerprint sensor. Once you've used it, you won't go back. The S5 is not that close yet in terms of usability with their sensor. The one in the iPhone 6 works really well. I definitely have found myself using my phone more because of how easy it is to unlock and install apps.4. Control of apps. This is an interesting point. In general, you get way more control over how to use and how to integrate your apps on Android than iOS. But in iOS, it's really interesting that you can control the kind of notification that gets sent to your phone, background refresh, location requirement, and access to certain things like photos and camera. In Android, you can do all of this as well, but sometimes for a lot of apps you have to have root access.5. Double tap to bring down the row of apps. I can't believe no one has thought of this before. A lot of Android phones have gigantic screens, but no one has really figured out how to best get the users to interact with that. You can tap the home button twice on the iPhone to bring down the top few rows of the apps so that you can access them in one hand use.Here are the things that I miss on Android:1. Full integration of almost any apps and control of default apps. I can set default apps on Android whereas Apple does not allow that. I can open up photos and upload them to Dropbox or any other app that I choose to, whereas Apple doesn't allow uploading to Dropbox via the Photos app (you have to open up Dropbox, then select upload and then go to Photos from there).2. Better email. In the mail app for Android, you can attach almost any file on the phone. You can't do that on Apple. You can't even attach a single file. You have to share a file as an email. So, forget about replying an email with an attachment. This is pretty annoying.3. Productivity is better on Android. If you are a big dropbox user, you probably know and love Dropsync on Android (seriously, best 5 bucks spent on any app). You can have an app that syncs and download any material from Dropbox onto your Android and then sync it back up when changes are detected. It's so seamless. Apple does NOT allow that (mainly because they don't allow background apps from accessing the hard drive, or something along those lines). So you have to download the file you are interested in manually from the Dropbox app. It just slows you down a lot, especially if you get to a part of a building where there is weak signal for wifi or cellular data.4. Notifications are way better. Why can't Apple make one button that clears all of your notifications? You have to individually close each app's own notification. I pretty much leave my notification screen untouched.5. Some other things that many already know: Google Now is way better/useful than Siri. Material design looks awesome! Way better widgets and the fact that you can have widgets!! Oh, and you can swipe right on the home screen on Android and that brings another screen from the left side... can't do that on iOS, the home page is set to be the left most one. More customization and etc.Conclusion:Overall, I think the iPhone is a fine device to use and you probably won't regret investing in one. The customer service from Apple is top notch, even if their parts cost an arm and leg. I think that, and I hate to say this because it's going to sound like every blog writer out there, the choice really does come down to personal preference and what you use the phone for. So, I've broken down my recommendation based on user case scenarios:If you are user type...Workaholic, Students: Android will be the best option unless your company/job dictates that you use an iPhone. The integration with all the apps and the feature with dropbox is just so important to anyone who works on their phones and other mobile devices. I would either get a pure Google device (N5 or N6, I like smaller phones... so N5 is up there) or a Google Edition device, or the Moto X. Samsung and HTC are also good choices but updates may be slow. One Plus One is actually pretty cool. They are not the best when it comes to customer service since they're a small company filling huge demand, but from my experience, the device is solid and definitely a work horse.Medical and Science community: iPhone. Unfortunately, most of the med and science people rely on Apple products, and a lot of new apps still come to iOS first or are better updated and designed on iOS.Recreational, use a phone as a communication device and for fun: iPhone. The camera and social apps are fun to use on the iPhone.For older folks: This is a split. If you've used Apple products before, then iOS will be easy to learn. Android phones have gotten a LOT easier to use thanks to a big push from Google dealing with not only the UI from a software perspective but also from a design perspective. It is more intuitive than it used to be.Photographer, blogger, foodie: iPhone 6 still has the best selection of apps and arguably the best camera. Samsung's camera is great, but the company is known to really bog down their stellar devices with bloatware that ruins or significantly slows down your phone after 1 year of use. I love the HTC ONE in design, but their gamble on the cameras have not paid off for their customers or themselves.So was this the right switch for me? As I'm learning more about the iPhone and iOS, I've realized that when the two year is over or whenever this phone dies on me, I'll most likely switch back to Android. While I think I've been thoroughly spoiled by the fingerprint sensor, the productivity that I enjoyed on Android just doesn't replicate itself here on the iPhone. Maybe it's not meant to be a super productive machine, but I guess my main point is that I'd like to have that option available when I need it.Another side note: Most of the shortfalls of either Android and iOS can be bypassed via means of rooting, custom ROMs, and jailbreaking (in the case of iOS). And I do understand that a lot of people enjoy doing this and can get their phones to work fantastically well. I used to do a lot of customization and go through ROMs once every three days on my Android devices, but I've come to realize that I'd rather spend that time using the device than customizing it. So, nowadays, I just want my devices to work right out of the box. The little details like a great camera, fingerprint sensor, and the ability to have my dropbox synced on the go and a good notification system should all be there when I turn on my phone.Summary and TL; DR:So there you have it. An Android user's thoughts on using the iPhone 6. Do I have regrets switching over? After using my friend's One Plus One and seeing Material Design on my old N4, I definitely regret it. But for now, the iPhone 6 suits my needs, even if there are occasional frustration points. If you are an Android user, please consider all these points and google similar stories before switching.Also, I'm one of those workaholics and forever in search of super productivity, hence my review that I'd like to go back to Android. However, I know plenty of people who swear by their iPhones for productivity. If you are always connected and depend on a suite of iOS specific apps (including apps that are better designed or work better on iOS), then chances are you love the iPhone. There are plenty of things to like and love about either OS. It really does come down to personal preference.***UPDATE 2/9/15: I got to try the new Outlook 2015 app by Microsoft, and it has alleviated a lot of the email/attachment issues that I have mentioned above. It allows you to sign into your Exchange, Outlook accounts as well as your Gmail, Yahoo, and iCloud emails. You can also integrate your OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Dropbox and Box accounts, and that's where the magic begins. Once integrated, you can attach any file located in those drives, which is great! You can also attach files that are attached in emails that are already in your inbox! And, you can now reply an email with the option of attaching a file. Finally, you can decide if you want to open up links from emails in Safari or another browser installed on your phone (so, you are no longer bound by default Apple apps). This is a huge step forward, and it's from Microsoft (a pleasant surprise). ***This app has really improved my productivity needs, since when considering the iPhone we have to take into account the hardware and the software/app ecosystem, i think this makes sense to bump up the rating to 4/5. There are still kinks when switching over if you are used to productive flexibility on Android phones, but right now the 3rd party apps are getting better and better at work-arounds.

Disappointed in iPhone,J w.,1,I just received my iPhone 6.  Was using iPhone 4s. I am disappointed in iPhone 6. It has poor battery life. I have gold my husband has space gray. They both loose battery life after 6-8 hours of r normal usage.  My iPhone 4s had better battery life.  I find it slower than expected. I thought Apple would have improved their technology more since iPhone 4s. Would not recommend upgrade until they improved. Regret getting this phone. It also get warmer to touch even with otter box defender case on. Updated April 26 2015. Still with closing out apps. Turning Bluetooth off.  Still loose battery power too quick. I have to charge throughout day. Came in package new. Disappointed in Apple iPhone 6 charge.

Awesome choice in a cellphone!!,MVorrath,5,I have gone from using a basic slider phone where I only had talk/text services through Sprint.  I had been eligible for a cellphone upgrade for over a year and was reluctant to go with a smartphone because I didn't want my monthly bill to jump.  In January I was at Best Buy browsing at the cellphones to see what was out there.  I was shocked to see that what I had been paying for that little talk/text phone through Sprint that I could have had unlimited talk/text/data for the same price.  Sprint has changed their individual plans to be more affordable.  Just about everyone in my family has an iPhone so I thought, "what the heck" I'll try the new iPhone 6.  I feel like I totally waited until the time was right and got the best deal ever!!  I TOTALLY love this phone!!Four Stars,srinu,4,Nice

I actually like it a lot,Gregory E. Johnson,3,I actually like it a lot.  Coming from the iPhone 4, I like that the 6 is "exactly" like it only taller, lighter, slimmer and much faster. I can't give it more stars (My actual rating would be 3 1/2) because I don't understand why they put the headphone jack on the bottom???? Which, would be ok IF the iTunes app orientated upside down!!!! It doesn't orientate upside down, unless I totally missed something and I tried.  They also moved the power button to the right side opposite the volume up button, so that when I power off, until I get used to it, I'm also pressing the volume up.  In other words, had they kept the power button and the headphone jack as it was on the 4, I would have given it a 5.Other features I really like is the keyboard that has the text helper above it.  The microphone function is sweet too, and I'm using it right now as I am talking this text.  It is accurate.  The camera is very sharp.  I do like the size of the 6 as it fits in my hand nicely. Considered the 6+ but don't want the bulk of a 6+ with a case.Did I say that this baby is FAST!

Still in beta? Inferior in every respect I can find but size.,fitz,2,I've had the 6 and the 6 plus and the 6 plus seems like it should still be in beta. The screen has been programmed to be less bright to save your battery life. The touch screen isn't as good, kind of like a Samsung, and the phone is slow, kind of methodical. It doesn't seem to have enough power to smoothly scroll. What happened here Apple?
Very satisfied,Arthur S.,5,Great telephone, very good seller.This is not my first iPhone, but it's the best one until now. Very fast with apps and good camera, even with low lights.The seller was fast and the package arrived even before expected. No surprises, iPhone model A1549, unlocked, working with all chips even overseas.

Like an android phone,Don Reyes,5,It looks, feels, and operates almost like an android phone, which is great, because it gets the Apple support and connectivity with the more intuitive android display and interface. The display is not the best in the market anymore, though. The G3 has definitely edged Apple out of this.

I've never had a iPhone,JJ,1,I have never own I anythig. I guess the die hard iPhone  zombies cannot unplug themselves long enough to see that their are actually wayyyyyy better phones out there. I for one have always been an android phone user myself always been pretty impressed. I notice on commercials when iPhone say they have the all new and voice activated blah blah. Well guess what my Samsung has done all that and more at least 6 months to a year before iphone. Ok thanks for reading my rant. Now try reading this again in a British accent.  Sounds way cooler
Needs sturdier design,joanie crawford,3,I love iPhones. If your buying this without a contract, I think the price point is high. It has upgraded technology from the previous phones. It works great. I just feel as though the design and durability of the casing. It seems like it would bend easily and the glass would pop out. It is very delicate and I'm disappointed in the construction of it. That's where it is lacking. It needs a sturdier design and then it would be a top notch phone. Apple should work on this for the future.
Five Stars,Xishengzhou,5,Pretty good, but Simon rob it. But it's OK
Five Stars,Amado Ovidio Gil Siqueiros,5,Works great! Awesome buy

There are no slowdowns and I didn't have to worry about any bend gate just slap a hard case on this and you'll be fine although I wouldn't recommend bending this with all your might

Bugs, Glitches, Issues,I. Radas,1,I have had so many problems with this phone that I felt obligated to write a review. I don't know what exactly happened here with apple but this product just has problems. Before anyone starts accusing me of being an Android fan  I want to say that I actually really like iphone over android, I have had both in the past and I prefer iOS when it works properly.So here is my user experience with this phone, I received this phone a couple months ago, and when I initially got it it worked great, everything was smooth, calls were coming through fine, I liked the design of the phone, I thought it was perfect. About 2 weeks after I received the phone, there was a new iOS update that came out, so I went ahead and downloaded the new update. That is the point that all my problems started. After the update there were two main problems, one was that text messages would never come through for many of my contacts, I just never received them, they said they sent them and I actually looked at the other persons phone and I never got what was sent to me. The other problem that I had was continuously getting dropped and failed calls, I would make 3-4 calls to a person before I finally got it to ring, and even than it would sometimes connect with a lot of static.I worked extensively with my phone carrier, I called 7-8 times and performed all the same troubleshooting with every technician I spoke with, each call was around 2 hours, some were more, so I probably spent close to 20 hours troubleshooting these issues, I was able to get the phone to operate better by disabling iMessage which helped my texts and than by disabling voice over LTE and just having it be for data. This and I had to reset network settings on my phone, reset the settings and content a couple times, I also had several things that my phone carrier did for me, including registering me to their network again. After all of this was said and done, I greatly reduced the amount of dropped, and failed phone calls and I also received all text messages coming to my phone from that point on. My phone carrier told me I should go to the store and get a new phone, but I didn't because most of the problems were gone and it seemed to be working the way it shouldOk, so issue resolved right? Well, yes with that device, what happened was I had to get a new iPhone, so my iPhone was sitting in a case, and it really wasn't even in my pocket or anything, one day the colors on the bottom right of my screen got dimmer for some reason. So I brought it up to my phone carrier and they looked at it, and they checked for water damage and this and that and said that the phone looks physically fine, and that I would need to go to an apple store and get it replaced. I went to the Apple store and worked with technicians there, they also confirmed what my phone provider said, and were going to replace the screen only, but after looking at my phone they said the button on the side was a little stiff so they said it would be best to replace the phone entirely, well because I was already there and had all those issues in the past I thought my phone just might not have been made correctly and that I have a bad phone so I agreed and got the phone replaced with a brand new one.I don't know what exactly happened or what they did, the phone was trying to get all of the apps downloaded again that I had on my last phone, it was downloading and installing them for literally 2 days which I thought was really weird. The new phone seemed much better in regards to calls that I was having problems with, but the phone would not open a lot of apps, it would start opening and freeze, than sometimes the screen would turn black and pressing the power button or the home screen would not illuminate your phone. Also holding the power button down when it did this did not do anything to the phone. I figured out a way around it by pressing the power and the home at the same time I think it restarts it and it goes through the loading process. However, sometimes the wifi would also disconnect, than I would go in and try to reconnect, but I wouldn't be able to turn the wifi on through the settings.So I have had this iPhone 6 since late November, it is now the End of Febuary, Febuary 28th to be precise. That is a good 3 months to try out the phone, and it works and stuff, and I am able to use it, but there are all kinds of glitches that I mentioned above now, related to the screen going out and wifi not connecting and apps not loading or freezing the phone. The problems are not consistant either, so when the phone works it's great, but I've had two of them now, and in both cases I've had different intermittent problems and bugs come up in the last 3 months. Since I waited for a while to make a review I feel that I can really assess the phone.Most of the people on here give this phone a 5 star rating, blindly rating it. This is not a 5 star phone. I had a iPhone 3GS in the past that I had no problems with at all, than I got an HTC one which I had no real problems with it, but as the device got old the hardware started going so it needed to be replaced and I got this phone now. I think iOS is a much better user interface than Android, but since iOS 8 has come out it is far more buggy than android. The androids may not be as user friendly and might be slightly more complicated to use, and may not get some of the apps or there may be delays or whatever, but the androids worked, the phones stayed on and you could make phone calls and get texts. So my opinion is that Apple really rushed this phone, they did not put in the time or quality that they are known forRight now my phone seems to be working ok I guess, but the reason I am giving it a one star is because:1. Quality: The amount of bugs and glitches in this device is not acceptable, the iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus are the most expensive phones on the market right now, customers are paying this amount because they are expecting a higher quality product and are willing to pay for it. When the phone has so many problems with it that it's useless at times, and having problems even after you get a new device that says to me that the devices are not made well.2. Price: This is one of the most expensive phones on the market and Apple is overcharging for this phone, I felt that I had to get a 64GB phone because it's 2015, 16 GB would fill up immediately when you consider how large the apps are nowadays or how big the pictures are as well.3. Hardware: As mentioned above, the entry point on this phone is 16GB, I don't think that is acceptable for a premium phone at this point in time. Further, there are real problems when it comes to multitasking because of the lack of memory, this phone comes with only 1GB of RAM, this was fine in the last generation but considering that they're supposed to be competing against Samsung when you compare other premium phones from competitors it's really unacceptable. The S5 by Samsung I would consider it to be the regular iPhone 6's main competitor, it has 2GB of RAM but has been on the market for much longer than the iPhone 6. The Samsung Note 4 is the iPhone 6 plus's main competitor, it came out roughly around the same time the iPhone 6 plus came out, but it has 3 GB of RAM vs 1 GB of RAM, anyone that multitasks or accesses heavily intensive applications is going to notice choppiness especially with future releases of their operating system like iOS 9 and 10 whenever they come out. Considering that an extra gig of RAM would have cost the company at most an extra dollar per model and you are paying hundreds of dollars to begin with this is not ok. Also when you go to the store and you want a 64 GB storage card it doesn't cost hundreds of dollars, so the difference in price between the 16 and 64 GB version should not be $1004. Customer Service - As I mentioned I have been having a lot of problems with my phone, and I tried getting a new phone through my cellphone provider. If you have similar problems with any other phone by any other brand they will replace your cellphone while it's under warranty right there at the providers store, this is not the case with Apple products though, when an Apple product breaks the company forces the consumer to go to their nearest Apple store and get it addressed there. This is a big inconvenience, because over the life of your phone you may need to get things fixed multiple times, some people live really far away from Apple stores and can't be without their phones so shipping isn't really an option. I don't think a company can act this way to their customers and this in my opinion even though I know it's minor compared to the other things I've mentioned is kinda a big deal for me, I had to drive around town, wait in line at their store, wait at a genius desk or whatever for close to an hour to speak to someone, and than had to go back and do it all over again, I resent the Apple store, because there are not that many and everyone that has an iPhone that needs something fixed is there from every carrier, so it's not like you're in and out of there.There are a couple of good features on this phone that I will mention, one is the design, it is really nice and sleek, and an elegant look to it, but appearance doesn't mean hardly anything to me after the first 5 minutes especially when the phone doesn't function properly. The second really cool feature is the camera, I read some people that bash this phone and they start talking about the camera and say it's no good, these people do not understand how optics work, the lense is spectacular quality for a phone, you have a f2.2 aperature (the lower the number the more light comes in) this is really unheard of in mobile devices, the people giving bad reviews on the camera compare megapixels, what they don't understand is megapixels hardly mean anything, once you reach 5 megapixels your eyes really can't see more pixels in a photo, so it has plenty, but the image quality and the camera on this phone are really top notch.With all the being said, if my phone(s) that I got worked and I had no problems with it, I would have rated this phone a 4, because I do value quality, but would deduct a little for price, and the RAM issue because I don't think a premium phone should only have 1GB of ram and find that insulting to the customer, but my phone did have problems and continues to have problems, with the price tag being as high as it is and what people are expecting this phone is a complete let down and disappointment, it's very frustrating to deal with these issues and bugs, and the company needs to release products not on some kind of yearly schedule so it can announce it at a keynote presentation but rather when the product is ready for the market. I want a quality item not something that breaks and has issues with it, otherwise I would have bought a free phone which I would expect to have some problems and be fine with it. The fact that this item has so many problems and is really promoted by every carrier as the best product that they carry is absurd.

I am overall very pleased with my iPhone 6,Kaity,5,I am overall very pleased with my iPhone 6. It has not caused me any problems, nor have any other Apple products that I have owned. The iPhone 6 is incredible compared to my iPhone 4s.The iPhone 6 is much larger than the original iPhones; it makes reading and typing much easier for those with poor eyesight and for anyone in general. IPhone allows passwords to be in place when your phone is locked. It gives a sense of security and preserves the safety of information stored on the device. It is a family friendly phone, the apps and ways of iOS are extremely simple to get acquainted to for any person of age. There is also a strong sense of order in the iPhone 6. The phone has a strong industrial look; it is clean cut, crisp, and straight to the point.

Great experience,Awan,5,It was a wonderful experience from quick shipment to delivery. Item found exactly as described. Just wonder why it didnt include the pin to replace SIM. Apple claims that every device package should have one. No big deal though. Not sure why is device getting hotter when used, but I'll give it some time before making any conclusions.

iPhone for the masses,joey,5,The iPhone 6 takes the best of what works for apple and brings it to a form factor that the masses want.  Once you get used to the larger size, it's a great device.  However, previous iPhone users beware: the size does take time to get used to.  It's a larger device that makes one handed use more difficult.  Other than that, it's what you would expect from an iPhone: reliable, great camera, great screen, and any app you could possibly imagine.
Five Stars,Anh Nguyen,5,Really nice phone. Works like every other iPhone and it has an incredible camera!
a few changes could be made but all in all great,Zachary Lehman,4,I wish there was a function for more then one timer. I cook/bake as much a possible and am needing to time multiple things at once. Also there should be a lock option for photos. I get that apple is all about simplicity but some things aren't fully functional about this phone. I love my apple products as much as anybody else. I wouldn't purchase any other phone, that's why I give it a 4. As long as they keep it the best phone around, I will keep purchasing.
Excellent,libvieira,5,Fast delivery, product as expected

An Android User's Review of the iPhone 6: Read this if you are thinking of switching from Android!!!,Jay,4,So I made the switch from using Android to the iPhone back in October, and I've been using the iPhone 6 for the past few months now and can give a detailed review on what it's like to switch over.  Before this switch, I've used the Samsung Galaxy S2 (first smartphone ever!) and also the Nexus 4.  Since I'm a tech enthusiast, I'm well versed and have played around with many other Android devices, including all the big names, Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 and M7, One Plus One, and so on.  Here are my thoughts:Things that the iPhone does really well (both hardware and software-wise):1. Camera.  The behind the scene software for digitally capturing an image is definitely the strongest sell for the iPhone.  Other than the S5 and Note 4, no smartphone really comes close to having the same kind of image quality (no matter the megapixels) compared to the iPhone.  This was one of the reasons for me to switch over since I've started to dabble with photography and wanted a really good camera in my smartphone.  (Side note, if you read a lot of tech blogs, there is a notion that in the near future our smartphones won't accurately describe our devices anymore since making a phone call is probably one of the least commonly used features on a smartphone when you look at any average user.  Cameras, social media, emails all take a higher usage rate than making a call... really interesting, but anyway, back to the review).2.  Reliability.  There have been maybe 2 or 3 times when my phone crashed and would have to be restarted, mostly due to playing some game that was not written very well for the iOS devices.  On Android devices, I've experienced a lot more crashes, and that may be due to the fact that so many apps haven't figured out the best way to optimize the app for each individual phone due to the fragmentation problems or something else.  Either way, I feel like the iOS environment and hardware is more reliable in my everyday use.3. Fingerprint sensor.  Once you've used it, you won't go back.  The S5 is not that close yet in terms of usability with their sensor.  The one in the iPhone 6 works really well.  I definitely have found myself using my phone more because of how easy it is to unlock and install apps.4. Control of apps.  This is an interesting point.  In general, you get way more control over how to use and how to integrate your apps on Android than iOS.  But in iOS, it's really interesting that you can control the kind of notification that gets sent to your phone, background refresh, location requirement, and access to certain things like photos and camera.  In Android, you can do all of this as well, but sometimes for a lot of apps you have to have root access.5.  Double tap to bring down the row of apps.  I can't believe no one has thought of this before.  A lot of Android phones have gigantic screens, but no one has really figured out how to best get the users to interact with that.  You can tap the home button twice on the iPhone to bring down the top few rows of the apps so that you can access them in one hand use.Here are the things that I miss on Android:1. Full integration of almost any apps and control of default apps.  I can set default apps on Android whereas Apple does not allow that.  I can open up photos and upload them to Dropbox or any other app that I choose to, whereas Apple doesn't allow uploading to Dropbox via the Photos app (you have to open up Dropbox, then select upload and then go to Photos from there).2. Better email.  In the mail app for Android, you can attach almost any file on the phone.  You can't do that on Apple.  You can't even attach a single file.  You have to share a file as an email.  So, forget about replying an email with an attachment.  This is pretty annoying.3. Productivity is better on Android.  If you are a big dropbox user, you probably know and love Dropsync on Android (seriously, best 5 bucks spent on any app).  You can have an app that syncs and download any material from Dropbox onto your Android and then sync it back up when changes are detected.  It's so seamless.  Apple does NOT allow that (mainly because they don't allow background apps from accessing the hard drive, or something along those lines).  So you have to download the file you are interested in manually from the Dropbox app.  It just slows you down a lot, especially if you get to a part of a building where there is weak signal for wifi or cellular data.4. Notifications are way better.  Why can't Apple make one button that clears all of your notifications?  You have to individually close each app's own notification.  I pretty much leave my notification screen untouched.5.  Some other things that many already know: Google Now is way better/useful than Siri.  Material design looks awesome! Way better widgets and the fact that you can have widgets!! Oh, and you can swipe right on the home screen on Android and that brings another screen from the left side... can't do that on iOS, the home page is set to be the left most one.  More customization and etc.Conclusion:Overall, I think the iPhone is a fine device to use and you probably won't regret investing in one.  The customer service from Apple is top notch, even if their parts cost an arm and leg.  I think that, and I hate to say this because it's going to sound like every blog writer out there, the choice really does come down to personal preference and what you use the phone for.  So, I've broken down my recommendation based on user case scenarios:If you are user type...Workaholic, Students: Android will be the best option unless your company/job dictates that you use an iPhone.  The integration with all the apps and the feature with dropbox is just so important to anyone who works on their phones and other mobile devices.  I would either get a pure Google device (N5 or N6, I like smaller phones... so N5 is up there) or a Google Edition device, or the Moto X.  Samsung and HTC are also good choices but updates may be slow.  One Plus One is actually pretty cool.  They are not the best when it comes to customer service since they're a small company filling huge demand, but from my experience, the device is solid and definitely a work horse.Medical and Science community: iPhone.  Unfortunately, most of the med and science people rely on Apple products, and a lot of new apps still come to iOS first or are better updated and designed on iOS.Recreational, use a phone as a communication device and for fun:  iPhone.  The camera and social apps are fun to use on the iPhone.For older folks: This is a split.  If you've used Apple products before, then iOS will be easy to learn.  Android phones have gotten a LOT easier to use thanks to a big push from Google dealing with not only the UI from a software perspective but also from a design perspective.  It is more intuitive than it used to be.Photographer, blogger, foodie: iPhone 6 still has the best selection of apps and arguably the best camera.  Samsung's camera is great, but the company is known to really bog down their stellar devices with bloatware that ruins or significantly slows down your phone after 1 year of use.  I love the HTC ONE in design, but their gamble on the cameras have not paid off for their customers or themselves.So was this the right switch for me?  As I'm learning more about the iPhone and iOS, I've realized that when the two year is over or whenever this phone dies on me, I'll most likely switch back to Android.  While I think I've been thoroughly spoiled by the fingerprint sensor, the productivity that I enjoyed on Android just doesn't replicate itself here on the iPhone.  Maybe it's not meant to be a super productive machine, but I guess my main point is that I'd like to have that option available when I need it.Another side note:  Most of the shortfalls of either Android and iOS can be bypassed via means of rooting, custom ROMs, and jailbreaking (in the case of iOS).  And I do understand that a lot of people enjoy doing this and can get their phones to work fantastically well.  I used to do a lot of customization and go through ROMs once every three days on my Android devices, but I've come to realize that I'd rather spend that time using the device than customizing it.  So, nowadays, I just want my devices to work right out of the box.  The little details like a great camera, fingerprint sensor, and the ability to have my dropbox synced on the go and a good notification system should all be there when I turn on my phone.Summary and TL; DR:So there you have it.  An Android user's thoughts on using the iPhone 6.  Do I have regrets switching over?  After using my friend's One Plus One and seeing Material Design on my old N4, I definitely regret it.  But for now, the iPhone 6 suits my needs, even if there are occasional frustration points.  If you are an Android user, please consider all these points and google similar stories before switching.Also, I'm one of those workaholics and forever in search of super productivity, hence my review that I'd like to go back to Android.  However, I know plenty of people who swear by their iPhones for productivity.  If you are always connected and depend on a suite of iOS specific apps (including apps that are better designed or work better on iOS), then chances are you love the iPhone.  There are plenty of things to like and love about either OS.  It really does come down to personal preference.***UPDATE 2/9/15: I got to try the new Outlook 2015 app by Microsoft, and it has alleviated a lot of the email/attachment issues that I have mentioned above.  It allows you to sign into your Exchange, Outlook accounts as well as your Gmail, Yahoo, and iCloud emails.  You can also integrate your OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Dropbox and Box accounts, and that's where the magic begins.  Once integrated, you can attach any file located in those drives, which is great!  You can also attach files that are attached in emails that are already in your inbox!  And, you can now reply an email with the option of attaching a file.  Finally, you can decide if you want to open up links from emails in Safari or another browser installed on your phone (so, you are no longer bound by default Apple apps).  This is a huge step forward, and it's from Microsoft (a pleasant surprise).  ***This app has really improved my productivity needs, since when considering the iPhone we have to take into account the hardware and the software/app ecosystem, i think this makes sense to bump up the rating to 4/5.  There are still kinks when switching over if you are used to productive flexibility on Android phones, but right now the 3rd party apps are getting better and better at work-arounds.

Music lovers... what you need to know.,Wayne,3,Feature to feature with Android, the most critical feature that's amiss with iPhone is the quality of their music services.  This may sound astounding to you as it was to me but iTunes is one of the worst music software or general software application that exists.  Portable music devices is what really put Apple over the top the last decade.  So you'd imagine iTunes would just work like it's supposed to.  You'd be surprised how bad it is if you're switching over from Android music services such as Amazon Music.  I've had most of my music collection on Amazon Music.  Switching to Apple I thought it would be as easy as subscribing to iTunes Match and pushing my collection to iTunes cloud.  Not so simple.  Using iTunes on my pc it failed to recognize more than half of my mp3s.  Apparently, this is a known issue with users complaining on the Apple support forums about how poor the matching software is.  It's slow when it works but most of the time it doesn't.  In comparison, Amazon Music matching is a breeze.  the quality of the code is superior.  Now when you subscribe to iTunes Match you're supposed to get iTunes Radio without commercials.  All I ever got was commercials on the iPhone and iTunes on PC.  So this is a backend problem not necessarily tied to a device.  The iTunes interface on iPhone is just horrible.  The Music app to play your music is also horrible.  The user experience is lacking with little update or innovation over the last several years.The biggest problem with iTunes is that it's not an AppStore application but tightly integrated with iOS release.  I'd imagine iTunes upgrades and enhancements would be markedly improved if it was separated out as it's own App Store app.  There's little likelihood this will happen anytime soon, however, as there appears to be a monetary reason behind this intentional tightly coupled integration.  When you use apps like Shazaam or SoundHound and intend to purchase a track you can only do so thru iTunes.  That's also a drag.  You can't purchase from, say, Amazon Music (android users know you can purchase tracks from any music provider on the platform).  For apple to continue their music monopoly on IOS they have to package the music services as part of their platform, that there are technical reasons why they can't open up their platform to 3rd party music purchasing services.  Therein lies their own demise of their music platform. There's little incentive to innovate.  What's odd even still is how anti-trust lawsuits haven't surfaced already.  If Microsoft can get slammed for shipping their own browser with their OS, then how is it that Apple can go unscathed for purposely limiting customers freedom to choose their music provider?IOS is pretty good in general.  It's definitely better than Android or a linux hacked OS.  It's better quality software in general and I like the fact the hardware doesn't get hung up in some deadlock.  I can almost always escape some kind of software locking through the home button which seems to force a hardware interrupt.  It's a better system software for sure.  iTunes and it's supporting software, however, is pure crap.  Thumbs up if you think this review will help anyone else make their switch over from android.

Four Stars,Prakash wagley,4,PositiveBest phone I have ever owned,Rodney K.,5,I went from a iPhone 4s to a galaxy s5 then to the iPhone 6 and it is by far the best phone I have ever had.  It is very fast and responsive.  The camera is excellent and does not have the delay that the s5 had.  The finger print scanner is excellent and a feature that is surprisingly useful.  You can unlock your iPhone with it or purchase stuff online with just your finger print.  I know the s5 also has one but it is years behind and can only be set up with one finger where the iPhone you can set multiple fingers which makes it nice if you switch hands while using the phone.  Also you have to swipe to unlock the S5 which can take multiple times to do where is the iPhone really takes more than a half second touch and unlock.  The battery life for me was about the same as on the s5 although I did like the power saving mode on the s5 which iPhone does not have.  The charging time on the iPhone seems to be about half the time it took to charge the galaxy S5 though so it's nice to know if you can plug it in for a few minutes you can charge about a percent per minute where the s5 was about 1% every two minutes. Another thing I prefer on the iOS system is Siri which is also years ahead of Google talk.  Much more useful, understands me better, many more functions and just much more refined.  If you're on the fence for a new phone the iPhone six will not disappoint you.

Amazing Camera, Great Battery Life and Nice Screen, but really big,AK529,4,This is actually my first iphone. I used to have a Samsung S4 before this. I tried the iPhone 6, but found it too small. Personally I wished that apple made an iphone thats around 5" or 5.2". Im not much of a phablet person, but I decided to try the 6 plus since I wanted an iphone which was larger than the 6. It took me a good 2 weeks to get used to using it. Its a great smartphone with amazing battery life. I can easily get 2-3 days usage out of it. I really like the camera. Its fast, the low light performance is great and its easy to use. The screen gets very bright for outdoor use in the sun. The speaker is very loud, good for music and calls. I do wish there was a stereo speaker. I also wish the 6 plus was smaller in dimensions. Apple has wasted  alot of space especially on the top bezel. The bottom bezel is understanable because of the touch id. Im sure apple will find a way to trim down the 6 plus when the iphone 7 comes out. Performance wise the 6 plus seems great you wouldnt be able to tell it only has 1gb of ram. Lte, 3g and wifi is fast. Call quality is great. Overall I like it but wish the dimensions were smaller and it had stereo speakers.

Fantastic, just one problem.,Joel,5,5 stars but one small problem. The front facing camera has a issue where it would change to different colors when I transition between photo, video etc... Also when FaceTiming or taking a photo with the front facing camera, the screen is white. Idk what's wrong so I looked it up and I see that everyone has this issue. Only once in a while will it work.

The best cell phone, ever?,B. Austin,1,The iPhone 6 is the pinnacle of mobile computing, a fast and beautifully engineered device that integrates smoothly with both Macs and iPads. I'm a Fanboy, yes, but I've tried Android phones. I've given the competition a fair shake. I went from an iPhone 4s to a Samsung Note 2 and then to a Moto X and I was so aggravated by the constant trade-offs that I finally just gave up and went back to Apple. Android devices stuttered when scrolling, didn't create hotspots when I needed them, and inconsistently connected to Bluetooth. Cameras were slow and awkward and you were lucky to get more than one or two OS updates (my Note 2 on T-Mobile never got 4.4). These are things I take for granted on an iPhone.So why the 1 star? Because Apple never ceases to disgust me with their power adapters. Great phone, horrible horrible cables. No other tablet or phone manufacturer uses a proprietary format and if one or two does, then they don't deliberately sabotage 3rd party adapters to force you into overpriced Apple ones. I needed a 30pin to Lightning adapter to control my iPhone from my car. $40 for the official Apple model. That's like buying HDMI cables at Best Buy. I'm pretty sure there's a chapter in Business 101 that says if you're getting compared to Best Buy, then you're doing something wrong.Last week I had to drive my wife's Buick. The 3rd party cables that worked in my car could not charge in hers. These same cables worked fine later when connected to my MacBook. So Apple is cool when you're using another manufacturer's cable connected to your Apple computer, but not the USB port in a car? That's just mean.The worst part is that Apple's got me bent over a barrel. I love their phones. Android phones may be bigger, faster, and have more features, but none provide the consistently I need from my phone. So I'm trapped with a drawer full of Lightning cables that may or may not work when I need them.

It's just too big. The iPhone 5 was solid and beautiful. The shape and feel of it was perfect. The only problem was battery life. I wish they'd stuck closer to this style and size but made it thicker to last longer.This new ones feel weak and flimsy and if it didn't have the double tap to bring the top down, I would've returned this and got the 5S. This phone works pretty well but the battery life still sucks and it looks like a Samsung. They also totally screwed up moving the off button from the top to the side so when its in your pocket you cant hit it. I think that Apple may be through now that Jobs is gone...The only reason I gave 3 stars is because it still has features I love but the design of the this phone is just weak, poorly designed and lacks the beautiful solid designs of the past.

Would buy again from this seller,lindamariacelina "lma",5,Love it !Stop complaining,diego,5,I don't really understand what this complaints in the reviews are about. If you don't like iPhones because "androids have way more technology" then don't buy and iphone and stick to android. Now if you drop a phone and it cracks it's not the phones fault you can't be careful enough to handle an expensive device and it also not the phones fault you are way to cheap to protect the phone which is an investment in my eyes. I work for sprint and I hear this on a daily basis. If you don't like the phone then stay away from it and if you break it don't complain about it if you didn't buy a case.
Excellent phone!,M. Howes "AnalogKid",5,3GS, 4S, and now a 6. Excellent phone!
Five Stars,Alejandro VIlchis,5,Excellent phone, haven't had any problem
I love my iPhone 6 plus,john browning,5,I love my iPhone 6 plus, I had the 5s and whenever I use my old phone( I gave it to my mother) I feel like I need a magnifying glass to use it. At first it took me a while to adjust to the size of the 6 plus but now I love it and would recommend this phone to everyone! The battery life is great, I can be texting and using my social media sites, from 7 A.M. To 5 P.M. and it only be on 40%. On my iPhone 5s I would have to charge it at noon. The graphics are also alot better!

So sooo in love!!,Pauly802,5,Ok so I have been getting a new iPhone now every year sense my first 3gs. I just love iPhones and everything about them. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because as great as they are the structure never seems to be as good as it should. I have shattered 3 screens now. The first two happened over a period of time and after many drops but with my iPhone 6 I shattered the screen the first week. I was bending down to grab something and it fell no more than two feet and that was it for the screen. The advancements to iOS 8 are amazing though. I've always preferred apple os. I will continue to buy iPhones every year as they come out!Five Stars,ejwork tsekara,5,Very nice
iPhone is the way to go,Daniel Psomas,5,Well I had a iphone 5, but wanted to try something new, so I decided to get a Samsung Note 4. Worst mistake, the iPhone's themselves are the best phones out there and you get more with your money. The Samsung had glitches and often times I would touch the screen and it would not respond, like an iPhone does. So needles to say I went back to my over 2 year old iPhone 5, and works better then a new Samsung. I guess I will never be making the same mistake by switching to another device. iPhone is the way to go. I wish they had some competition, but apparently not.  Then I switched over to the iPhone 6, greatest decision has a larger screen that is clear with a faster processor. I am very impressed with what I got and it came as advertised and fast shipping!
Looked good but sound quality super faint and it was super ...,Munemo Mushonga,1,Not sure if was real. Looked good but sound quality super faint and it was super lite. Panicked and sent it back. Just go to the Apple Store

Think twice before buying I-Phone,Cetinkaya,1,I have been an Apple user for the past 5 years. I have used I-phone 4, Iphone4s,Iphone 5,Iphone 5s, Apple TV, IPAD 2, and IPAD mini. My first apple product I-Phone 4 is still working. Apple has changed since then especially after Steve Jobs. I think new products are unreliable. I am upset because I am getting ready to bury my I-Phone 5 because it turned off without a reason and now apple associate calls it a "dead unit." I have been using it for one and half years. I took care of it very nicely. On Monday it turned off randomly couple times, i restored it and it did not help either. Now it is not turning on. I took it to Apple store and they said that it is dead unit and out of warranty that i should have bought extended warranty. It is frustrating since i did not use at least for two years.If you are planing to buy I-Phone 5 or I-Phone 6, think twice. I am done with apple products, not buying I-Phones any more. If you are buying I-Phone 6, you are good at least for a year (limited warranty).

Apple is going to sh....,J. A. Maynor "Be the change...",2,This phone will serve its purposes but it just might be the last Apple product I buy.After unboxing my phone and running through the normal procedure of getting my info into it, I noticed the screen made a popping noise. I could literally push the screen in about a millimeter.I scheduled an appointment with Apple and they took a look at it with their team of geniuses and concluded that it was within normal operation. I told them that having a loose screen is a bad design and the guy actually scoffs at me, and says, "for what? A mere millimeter of movement?"So, come to find out, this is a known issue and it will not be resolved any time soon. It's considered "normal". Go ahead and Google loose screen iphone 6. I'm not the first and won't be the last. I've always been an apple user but I seriously think that the company has peaked and is on its way to being mediocre at best.The new iPhone 6 is the best iPhone out there,Juan,5,The new iPhone 6 is the best iPhone out there. My iPhone 6 was a Christmas present but I got it 3 weeks early thinking they would sell out for the holidays. My dad, mom, sister, and me all got the iPhone 6. When they first handed me my phone I felt like I wasn't holding a phone. I felt like I was holding something out of this world. And that's what Apple does every time they make a product. They make sure you will love it till the end. Whenever you get a new iPhone, no matter what generation, you will be holding something that is worth its pricing. Some might say, oh the iPhone is too expensive, but if they made the effort to get one, they would understand it's not too expensive. Its pricing is just fine. I upgraded from the iPhone 4s to the iPhone 6. That's a big upgrade. All I can say is I really recommend the new iPhone 6. You will love it just as much as I do.
again,Kindle Customer,5,Nice
Five Stars,JuhuiLee,5,good
Great phone but VERY easy to drop,Mr Bill,5,The iPhone 6 is a great smartphone in all respects, but compared to my iPhone 5 and the earlier iPhones, the iphone 6 is much more " slippery" and likely to be dropped.  The light weight, the smoothly rounded tapered edges, the thinness, and the slightly larger size all contribute to this. So in my opinion a case, even a thin minimalist case, is absolutely necessary to avoid expensive damage.

My friend bought one.. not worth the money ...,Carlos colon,3,My friend bought one..not worth the money..don't spend your money..no phone is worth that price..only for a dummy who want to give his or her money away
Great for Apple fans,Robert,3,I purchased this phone since my employer wants their employees using an Apple product for their apps.  I've used Android and Windows phones as well. The pros are good build quality, nice display, good sound and call quality, decent battery life. But, IMO, you can get all this with an Android device at a fraction of the cost. Die hard Apple fans will be happy regardless. Windows phones are by far the best bang for the buck, but apps are still limited.  Several big annoyances for me with the Apple phone. You're stuck having to install and use iTunes to manage the phone such as to add music or ringtones. Even with the majority of 3rd party programs, iTunes still needs to be installed for them to work. If there is any bug or problem with iTunes, then you can have problems. I could not get music on my PC to sync with the phone whether using iTunes or a 3rd party program. The transfer would just fail without any warning. After more than 20 minutes on phone with Apple tech, who couldn't figure the problem out, I was disconnected and never got a call back. Ended up trouble shooting the problem myself and discovered the trouble was from the iTunes installation being on a "locked drive". Google "repair security permissions for itunes for windows" for the solution.  If you don't have unlimited data, and want to turn cellular data off, you may find your bluetooth voice commands won't work.  You'll need to turn Siri off for them to work, otherwise, you'll have to listen to Siri telling you to connect to the internet.  If you're a fan of Apple and don't care about price, or there is a business need to use Apple, buy this phone. If you want value for your money, have the freedom of choice, and to optimize for your personal use, then you have many more and better options elsewhere. A final word, imo, if you want the best price on an unlocked gsm iphone 6, buy it direct from Apple.  I can verify that the no contract T-mobile iphone 6 they sell will work just fine with an AT&T sim card.

I love this phone,Jere in Miami,5,I love my phone!  I ordered Gold and it is beautiful, but I recommend black because my Gold one has a white frame around the face..... like the photo here.  The 'frame' on black one is black.... can't see it.... phone looks bigger.I use my own personal case and that covers the Gold anyway, so I recommend black.
Five Stars,DIEGO S.,5,Everything OK!
Great Phone, but needs work!,Chris M,4,I'll lead in to this letting everyone know I have a love/hate relationship with Apple being an Apple user since the early 90's. I have seen the things that have changed and the things that have stayed the same as Apple has moved from being a sinking dinghy to a thriving cruise line.I switched from Android to this iPhone, but I have had quite a bit of experience with iPhones as my family has them, I have a model for work, etc. In general Android is far more flexible in allowing the user to create their own experience. It's like a car, you pick the model with the factory and dealer installed options you want and then you can make your own changes. Apple limits the user modifications heavily (specifics below).I switched from Android because I was tired of all freezes, pauses and crashes and all the iPhone reviews state the opposite. My hope is that I can live without the customization abilities to get a more stable and responsive solution. So far my experience is the iPhone is hands down the better hardware, better hardware/software integrate and has far better performance and stability.For reference on performance and stability, I have 154 apps installed, am using 75.2GB of the storage, 60.4 for purchased videos, 3.7GB for Photos & Videos taken by the camera, 1.7GB Music, 2.7GB for Apple's productivity apps, 182MB mail (8 mail accounts, 3 are Exchange accounts), have custom mail signatures for all accounts, custom notifications for everything including different notifications for each mail account, use the Do Not Disturb feature option and have it enable automatically in the evening, use the Control Center and Notification Center often, have customized the Notification Center, Wallpaper on the home and lock screens, use WiFi, Bluetooth and VPN often, use iCloud and Passbook/Apple Pay, have many alarms, etc. Point is with all this the iPhone is responsive and stable and with a few exceptions the iPhone version of apps have been better than their Android counterparts.Batter life seems better, but comparing a Galaxy Note 2 (2 years old) with a current iPhone is not fair. As far as the other comparisons, I know people who have Galaxy S5's, Note 4's and other android phones and the performance and stability problems still exist which is backed by the reviews.I will say that the camera is not as amazing as indicated. I have had many issues with graininess and very slow focus. It's certainly hard to get a good picture quickly.I have been told that the iPhone is a more polished product and I would agree, but I would say it's a very polished version 1.5 to 2.5 product. However, some items are clearly further along because Apple has focused on those apps/features.The most glaring thing lacking customization in the iPhone, the version 1.0 item, is the clock. With everything that Apple does to make our lives easier, they are glued to a 1970s/1980s electronic alarm clock paradigm.1) You have no control over snooze time and therefore, there is no default setting that the user can change, no per alarm snooze time option and no on the fly snooze time options.2) An alarm can be set for the next occurrence of the time you set or every x day, but not this Friday just one time or for a specific date. You have to set your alarm the day before or if your future planning fits with the limited options, you can plan your alarms ahead. So I'll create an alarm, turn it off and then set a reminder to remind me to turn it on. That seems more complicated than it should be.3) Someone will say, just replace the clock, except only the Apple clock works with an option like Do Not Disturb on, so if DND is on you have to leave a 3rd party clock app up on the screen, not in the background, for the alarms to work. I use DND because during sleep time I only want calls, texts and alarms and I can click the silent switch to disable call and text sounds on the fly.The bottom line is that it is clear that Apple does not care about this app and there is not a good replacement option.Another glaring issue is iMessage and SMS. Why do I need to care if my contacts iPhone is connected in a way that allows special iMessage messages. If iMessage can't reach an SMS device via iMessage, then it should automatically send the message as SMS. It should not take 10 minutes or hours or days or longer if ever for people to get a text. I can turn those features off, but I lose functionality that does not require iMessage that Apple only provides for iMessage contacts. This is another immature thing. It's like a CD player made by a record label that only plays CDs produced by said label.This and the lack of being able to seamlessly use Google Voice are the only things that keep Android in my view. For reference, in Android you can set your default app to use for everything including phone, messaging, etc. So if I opened the main phone app, typed in a number or selected from the address book, when I clicked call it would call with my default which could be my Verizon number or my GV number or I could set it to ask me. So yes I can use GV on my iPhone, but not with that level of convenience.The list below is not exhaustive, but provides a good example of why I consider it version 1.5 to 2.5 software.1) Already covered alarm clock app, iMessage and SMS and app integration like I described with Google Voice.2) No status indicator when in silent mode (switch on side of phone). Some have said just look at the switch. Well there are a number of reasons why that is not the best option for everyone. It's hard to see in the dark. If you have a case it's even harder to see. By that logic, get rid of all status icons and you can go to the respective setting to see the status of that item. It's a simple status icon and there should be an option to show it.3) When selecting from the address book to add contacts to mail, imessage, etc, it would be awesome if you could select multiple. i.e. I may search for work contacts and want to select more than one rather than performing the same search over and over.4) Limited options when working with Bluetooth and WiFi connections. You can forget a device and with Bluetooth, there may be some options, but you can't simply disconnect from a device or network and with bluetooth you can't limit what the device is used for. i.e. I may have a bluetooth earpiece for making calls, but I may not want music to come through that device.With the disconnect sometimes it's convenient to disconnect without turning off the feature especially with bluetooth which should support multiple pairings. For WiFi, I had an issue where it would not see other networks. Turning it off and on did not fix the issue. I had to forget the network that it was automatically attaching to and then I could see other networks. Having to forget a device or network should not be the solution. That should only have to be used if you want to forget the item or there is a problem with that specific item.5) For Do Not Disturb you have one auto option so you can have auto on/off on different days and when turning it on on the fly you have no option to turn it off after a period of time.6) The Command Center is nice, but it leaves much to be desired. Being able to quickly turn items on and off is nice, but what if you want to choose a specific WiFi network or Bluetooth device.How about being able to click and hold to select from a list of devices/networks with an option to open the WiFi/Bluetooth main settings?At the very least, and this should be there even if the more specific options described above are provided, a button to open settings.How about allowing an option to allow the Command Center to be accessed via the Notification Center (pulled from the top)?7) Changing settings can be a pain. I do like that there is a single place you can go for some settings such as notifications, Cellular Data Use, privacy, etc and a single place to quickly get to all app settings, but that benefit should not remove the ability to get to all of these settings from within an app. It's the equivalent of adding steering wheel controls for the radio, a/c, etc and removing the corresponding console controls.8) The mail app is nice, but there are some issues.When adding a more complex (standard) signature with an image and hyperlinks, the settings app crashes and it looses my images, so a couple of emails have the image and then the image disappears.Not being able to set per folder "Mail Days to Sync" is a bummer. I have folders that I keep all important mail in that I need access to offline. I have other folders that have a lot of mail and I do not want all the messages in those folders to download when I do have to look at them on occasion. There needs to be more flexibility with this option.The options unread, To or CC, VIP, Flagged, attachments, etc per mailbox would be nice.This is my review and I hope it helps you!
I realy like this iPhone6 bc this is amazing and adorable I ...,Warner C.,5,I realy like this iPhone6 bc this is amazing and adorableI will not compare this to other products bc I know apple is one the biggest nkown brand and this service is very nice than othersmy expectations for iphone6 is nice camera and the battery will longI will describe the amazon is very nice and the service is very good
power and frame issues,tony chan,3,Wife bought one, which was defective (plate was loose), Verizon replaced it and works like any other iPhone bit with a larger screen. I purchased one and returned it after the home button would overheat and the battery drained completely in 3 hours with nearly no usage. So, 2 of 3 iPhone 6 we purchased were defective. I think they are trying to push out as many phones as possible and they're sacrificing inspection and quality control measures. Otherwise, for the average person who waste their money on these expensive phones and never full uses it to it's full potential, this is just like any other iPhone with a bigger screen. Not worth it to me. Cost to product ratio would result in low star rating for me
great device - has some physical design issues,MKOW,5,This is my 2nd iPhone (Verizon), coming from an iPhone 5.I'm an Apple enthusiast so this was an obvious choice for me.Overall, the phone is awesome but I not necessarily suggest anyone immediately upgrade from the 5/5s unless they are compelled to do so.It is fast opening and closing apps, websites, etc. but not a huge difference to make me suggest to hurry up and buy it.I only got an iPhone 6 because my daughter was in need of her first iPhone, so it made sense to give her my old iPhone 5.The screen response is perfect and the thumb print works 90% of the time and is really convenient to get into the phone.There are a few shortcomings, however:1. The protruding rear camera lens is just stupid - so you really can't set the naked phone on its back without worrying about it.2. The rolled edges on the glass are just stupid - this means that a screen protector cannot go edge to edge.  It also means that most any case will have a gap between it and the glass at the eye of the case.3. Too thin - yes, this phone is too thin - hence the protruding rear camera issue.  Thinness also contributes to making the phone very slippery and very easy to drop.  Maybe that is what Apple wants - drop the phone often so you have to replace it often?4. Confounding the thinness issue are the rounded edges.  Rounded edges make many cases very easy to slip off, or at least not fit as snug as they otherwise could.5. Not case friendly:  Thin + round edge + rolled glass edges = a very unfriendly phone to accepting cases and screen protectors.  Overall, I find the old iPhone 5/5s much easier to fit a case to it and install a screen protector.So, the iPhone 6 is a very cool device. For everyday use like email and Internet, I really do not notice any speed difference, but some web pages open slightly faster. Buy this phone for increased screen size.  I like the screen size, but would probably have bought a smaller (normal?) screen if they made that - the added size does make it a bit less "pocketable." The 6+ seems like it would be too large for most folks - where do you carry it?  I ended up with the Otterbox Defender case, BTW, and it seems to work out fine and is very protective and still fits in my back pocket, shirt pocket, or cargo-pant pocket (I drop my phone a lot, so it suits my needs).I use it for work, play, investing and checking stocks, pictures, video, texting, notes, to-do list, play guitar with iRig, music, emergency flashlight, reading news, reading Kindle books, watching YouTube and Amazon instant video, running apps, hands-free phone in car, and the list goes on and on.  What other purchase on the planet enables so many things to be done with it?  A smart phone is a no-brainer, really.  So, at this point I will always have an iPhone. And my wife and daughter have iPhones too. Just so convenient on so many levels and essential to stay in touch in a busy lifestyle.  Pictures do seem crisper with this phone.  You can't go wrong with this device. Period.But that does not mean it is perfect - the physical deficiencies I have noted, IMHO, are a step backwards for this device, performance aside. The protruding camera, really, by today's standards and by Apple's design theme of sleekness, is just stupid and very unexpected. But, at the end of the day, it is an iPhone and functionally it does exactly what I have come to expect it to do.

Good phone, but Apple could have done much better.,ART,4,I have been using iPhones for 4 years, and I have to say that this latest version is much faster than iPhone 5s. Though, it has some issues related to the new iOS (i.e Alarm won't go off, some app does not work on it) and design flaws. The curved corners seems to be nice, but if you look at them closely, you will see they were not able to make the corner as clear as other parts of the iphone, Kind of messy work there for a company like Apple. Other than than, I feel they kind of copied Samsung Galaxy S3 phone lock/turn on/off button. Other than this, iPhone 6 is still much better than the Galaxy phones or any android based smartphones I have tried.
Great unlocked iPhone 6,Hockey Mom,5,I wanted to write a review because the reviews that I read were very important to me when I was trying to decide what iPhone 6 to order. My iPhone 6 is working GREAT!  We live overseas and so I had to buy an unlocked phone to be able to use in the states and overseas.  This one worked awesome!  I did take it to my local AT&T office to switch the chip, but that is more because I am not technically savvy and wanted to make sure that nothing went array.  I would recommend this phone and this seller.
SUPERB SERVICE,NICOLAS STARZENSKI,5,EXCELLENT STUFF. SURPASS MY EXPECTATIONS. COMPLETELY SATISFIED. EXCELLENT DELIVERY SERVICE.

iPhone 6 A1549 unlocked, just OK...,Osiricat ">> By Osiricat",3,I got this one through TechnoMaster. Good seller this`s my 2nd iPhone Unlocked through this guys. This is iPhone 6 Model A1549, works with DIGITEL in Venezuela also LTE is properly working. I also try a Telefonica SIM in Mexico, and AT&T Sim in the US with no issues at all. Truly an unlocked one. Box come in original sealed package.Why I choose 3 stars? Well, I`ve been an iPhone user since 1st gen iPhone, iPhone3, iPhone4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPhone 5S and meanwhile this iPhone 6... I`ll always felt better with every new iPhone until this one. I believe iPhone 5S is equal or a little faster than this iPhone 6, also the user experience with phone proportions is better in iPhone 5S. Is really annoying need to use the "smart small screen" function (press home button in a tricky way) because the screen is so big that you need to use both hands for some functions. Yes the bigger screen is great when you have the time to browse the web, read your emails and so on, also to people with vision issues (the bigger letters are simple better), BUT for me, I use this iPhone mainly LIKE A PHONE, and it is just better the iPhone 5S size for FULL and faster functionality with only one hand.Also, I`m really MAD with iOs bugs, for example, if you use the "Vibrate/Sound" Button several times a day (I use it A LOT), well the iPhone just won`t sound at all, if you use Music it just muted, no matter how many times you press play/puse, stop, close all apps, turn switch to vibrate-sound  100times... if anoyone sent you a video through whatsapp it won`t sound, surfing the web: no sound, and so on... only fix: TURN OFF/ON your iphone... really??Another anyoning bug: Assistive touch function, I told you guys before that the screen is too big to use with only one hand, allright, iOs has this pretty cool function that shows a virtual HOME BUTTON into ur screen (I used it a lot in my last iPhone 5S), well you put this litte cool button in the middle left or right of the screen (to have it near of ur finger, right?) well, iOs just troll you and move it into the farest corner just to avoid you little finger to use it and have to use again: BOTH HANDS, ok you got me, where`s the hidden camera guys?...Another bug? iCloud control panel for windows sucks, iCloud photos stop sync (with PC or mac) when it wants, just simply dont work.Another one? Sometimes is just slow... with 5-10 apps openend or no one, iOs animation slows the use experience, even if you DISABLE animation in advance options...I`ve been using this iPhone6 for almost two months, and I`m not totally happy with it, its the more expensive phone I ever own, I wish I had for almost 1.000 bucks: the same coolest screen size, FASTER phone with a BRILLIANT iOS like it was in golden Apple years... this one its not the better I have owned.Meet all expectations,Rodrigo Toro,5,Meet all expectations, works fine abroad. I'm using it in Ecuador, South America and works flawless. I give the seller five stars.
Five Stars,Ardeshir Bozorgmehr,5,its cool
Nothing to see here,jamie,3,I gave this phone 3 stars because Apple uses FoxCon boards, I think being a techie and knowing FoxCon makes low quality parts pushes me away from Iphone the. I have had a 3gs a I4, I5, and a I6, I end up usinga Samsung Galaxy line of phone.I am not a fan boy, I still favor BlackBerry,  but they lost me when they never moved on to touch screen, buy that time I moved on after years of loyalty.

another step on the ladder, but screen is a bit big,Run With Them Or Fear Them,4,bought it for friends who are apple fanatics and say the screen is better than ever- wouldn't trade up for the bigger screen even at the same price.  this one is a little bigger than the last iphone and if anything it's too big
I bought a golden 6 iphone, unlocked on 16 ...,Marina R,1,I bought a golden 6 iphone, unlocked on 16 December and brought to Brazil because I live here.Arriving had the unfortunate surprise to discover that it is LOCKED.Do not understand what happened because the specifications of the product and according to the almost $ 800 price was clear that this was an unlocked product.Now I have a cell blocked by AT & T operator, which does not work here in Brazil.I paid $ 800 for an unlocked cell phone while a locked cost me only 200.To unlock my phone here in Brazil I have to pay a fee, but I know of no reliable place to make it unlocked.I am very upset and dissatisfied with the product.
Five Stars,alex,5,Very fast and ligther than Iphone 5S.
Good but is great?,Bill Parkinson "Techboy",4,Like the bigger screen and very sleek but so sleek it can fall from your hand so be careful
but it was a very painful process. The migration doesn't work,Michael Karpa,2,I eventually got it to function, but it was a very painful process. The migration doesn't work. It is not compatible with older iPhones/macs. Tech support is unable to solve the problems. Be prepared to spend many hundreds of dollars on new peripherals, computers and software to get it to work. Also, after the latest iOS update, it no longer works with my car stereo.

***APPLE COULD DO BETTER BUT IT'S DEFINITELY THE BEST ON THE MARKET***,Branden M,4,Apple always surprises me but I know they have the tech to make the iphone better. This phone is awesome but it is very difficult to bend. Apple has a great app store as well as opporating system. I have had this phone for 2 months and it is awesome!!

Four Stars,aymar giglio junior,4,Expensive but amazing.Disappointed and returned phone. Went back to using iphone5.,KendraM,2,I went from the iphone5 to the iphone6 and the only difference I noticed is the physical size of the phone being bigger (obviously) and the feature that allows the thumbprint to unlock phone without typing in the security code. Other than that there are no differences. I was really hoping the iPhone6 would be faster but that definitely did not happen. I was so disappointed that I returned the iphone6 and went back to iphone5. Maybe the next one will be better.
Amazing. 0.0,Ali Karim,5,This is the best smartphone i've owned in years. I've been an Apple collector since the IPhone (1st Generation) came out. Thank you Apple ;)

One Star,ognjen rondovic,1,Bulls***
Too pricey,Tanner Ostenson,2,To start, this phone is so overpriced. Apple has gotten to a point where they've drawn in all their customers and Apple knows they can't escape. Because of this, customers will pay basically anything short of their first born to buy this phone. The price can't even be explained by its features. As an example, Galaxy S5 has just about the same amount of features plus more (waterproof, auto-encryption, multiple users using Android L.)Also, the durability is also garbage. How often do you see an iPhone with a cracked screen? Almost every day! Galaxy products, to use the same example as before, are a lot more tough and durable. I've dropped my phone multiple times, yes I'm careless, and it doesn't have a scratch on it. This way, I don't have to waste MORE money on buying a case just to protect the said "smart glass."Overall, it's a high price for a cheap phone.

Apple is quickly slipping. I hated using android because of glitches but this is no better. Poor screen resolution comparatively,Bogdan111,1,I was using the Galaxy s5 waiting for the iPhone 6 to come out because I hate android due to nothing but glitches on the android. Well, I don't know that the new iPhone is any better. It is beyond frustrating how a complacent industry titan pushes out mediocre products assuming customers will buy them because it's "Apple". The new iOS 8 is just unusable with the glitches. I cannot even begin to list the issues from freezing to force closes to the phone randomly making sounds when on silent. Aside from that the screen resolution is lacking considering all new android phone have a considerably higher pixel density. The fingerprint scanner is a joke and works I would say one third of the time having to keep retrying to unlock. Overall, after paying a premium for this product I could not be more unhappy.
Five Stars,Khalifa,5,Thanks
A wonderful phone, best iPhone yet!,John Egbert,5,I have always been an avid iPhone user, ever since the 3 was released. This one just takes the cake, by far surpassing all it's predecessors. I picked this phone up at target and from the moment I got it out of the box I was blown away. The screen size, I feel, fully unlocks the potential of iOS in general. It's really sharp and easy to see. The camera is amazing too, my favorite part is the built in slow-motion feature, which works flawlessly. It takes beautiful photos and videos. This phone is also exceptionally faster than all its predecessors, apps launching in record time. It's super sleek and wonderful and I couldn't be happier.The only problem I can really find is that sometimes when you have portrait lock on and open the camera, the gyro goes completely wonky and thinks that the iPhone is upside down, therefore resulting in upside down photos. I hope this will be fixed when I update my software today, but if not I just edit the image and flip it around.

Five Stars,Juan Pablo Esteban,5,It works very good in Colombia . Best smart phone in the market100$ more than Apple Store?,sharan,1,What's the difference between this phone and the one sold from Apple? Apple Says 1 month contract needed from T-Mobile but it's not needed, we can use any network. Apple Store full price phones are unlocked. You are paying 700$ in Apple I'm not convinced why we need to pay $800 here
amazing price. Love the product,Michaela,5,Fast shipping, unlock, new, amazing price. Love the product!! I would definitely recommend this seller and his products!
Sorry?,gidolgibor,4,I have given all previous iPhones 6 stars but not this one.Pros:1. Operating system is fast and easy to use2. The camera and its features are unparalleled3. Battery life is very long. A full charge will last me full day and a halfCons:1. The phone's construction and materials are subpar. First time ever2. The speakers are poor3.

I do not recommend you wasting you money on this,Elijah Carney,1,Crappiest iPhone I've ever owned. I had tempered glass and a case and it cracked from a small drop onto my metal bed frame. My brother was walking and somebody accidentally tripped him and it fried the system and Apple is going to charge $300 to fix/replace the device. Not durable at all. I do not recommend you wasting you money on this.

im very satisfied!,Pedro Ramonda,5,It Works in Argentina, im very satisfied!
Five Stars,bruno,5,YeahhWay too fragile,Justin,1,I've been an iPhone guy since the beginning, but I'm pretty salty after my experience with the 6. In fact, I will probably never buy another iPhone. I dropped my 6 at most two feet after about three weeks of ownership. It landed on the back of the phone, yet somehow the glass shattered. I've had two friends with the same issue. Mind you, I should've bought a case. But what's the point of a "sleek" and "thin" phone if you have to put a bulky case on it to protect it? I've dropped my other iPhones from higher distances on harder surfaces with almost no damage (and no damage to the screen at all).Then, I bought a kit to fix it. I'm not much of a techy, but I broke down the phone to the last step (after hours of work...again because I'm slow) only to realize there is not way to fix the screen. The glass and touch screen panel are fused together. You cannot fix your phone without sending it back to Apple for a couple hundred bucks!!! Meanwhile, Droids are very easy to fix. I've seen it done a few times. It's as if Android cares about things like easy repairs whereas Apple wants you to fork out more money. I find this to go against everything the company used to stand for or at least what we were told Apple stands for - caring about the end user/customer.Anyhow, the phone is probably fine if you get a case right away. If not, be very careful with it because the slightest knock off a table will likely crack the glass.Oh and Apple won't care about your issue. They've cornered the market in the US, so an unhappy customer here and there doesn't matter. Not when they can keep running those same commercials over and over again about how great it is.
Where's the 160 gb iPod Classic?,Jonathan Scott "Songe",1,Where's the 160 gb iPod Classic?  You took away the best and replaced it with high-priced silliness.

Five Stars,shadia watrud,5,Very good
Nothing much has changed about the iPhone,tonya,2,Nothing much has changed about the iPhone, other than this one won't fit in your pocket. That's the "bigger and better" part of it. It's gorgeous without a case but too risky! Won't be an iPhone until the screen cracks. It'll shatter your hopes, dreams, and regret not insuring it on top of how expensive it is. The camera is amazing, you'll feel like a photographer. However, the new photo and video attachment feature can be your worst nightmare; you have no privacy. Oh, and have fun with the new iOS8 feature! The new iPhone 6 serves for those looking to spend.
Five Stars,Ismail Mbabali,5,loved it.
Five Stars,ziyad,5,excelent
Both deisgn and quality of the iPhone have suffered significantly over the years (the quality of the glass is so poor it scratch,typically lenient,1,Previously I owned an iPhone 4 and an iPad 2. These were my first ventures into the apple world. They were both marvels of design and engineering. So much so I was considering a switch to a Mac for my computing needs. I skipped the iPhone 5 but thought it about time to upgrade when 6 became avaialable. Having it now for 2 months I would rename it iCrap6. Both deisgn and quality of the iPhone have suffered significantly over the years (the quality of the glass is so poor it scratches if you stare at it).  This convinced me not to upgrade the iPad so I installed iOS 8. Another mistake.  My old iPad has never worked so poorly.  As for moving to a Mac, the idea has completely disappeared from my head. It seems the philosophy of Apple has also disappeared from the corporate psyche.
Buy Applecare,J. Patrick Cronin "PC Man",3,The new size provides an amazing easier screen to read especially for someone like me with glasses. I find myself squinting less and actually using my phone to read and resound to email instead of opening up my mac. The video editing and integration with the mac make life easy. I can text, talk, or FaceTime on my mac close it down in the middle of a conversation and continue that conversation on my iPhone.Beware that the out of warranty price at the writing of this review is $299 for the iPhone should the screen crack. I searched around for a cheaper alternative when my son's phone dropped and shattered in the first week. The cheapest non-apple alternative I could find was $330 because the part alone is nearly $300. I was surprised that by merely falling out of a pocket the phone looked like it exploded. We've had iPhone 4, 4s, and 5s where they fell and the screen cracked (and more times where no crack showed). For whatever reason, the iPhone 6 seems extremely fragile. The guys at apple were understanding but admitted that they're seeing a lot more come in with damage than prior models.
Real value == $400,Hil,1,Quite a few people like to show off their iPhone 6 as a symbol of status. Apple has created such a brand with last year's technologies to lure people. While Samsung, LG, Motorola and other top Android manufacturers are pushing the limit of smart phone technologies, Apple has lagged behind for 1 year on the hardware front and 2 years on the software front with Google. I wrote another review regarding the camera comparison between iPhone 6, 6+, and LG G3. The photo samples are at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-mVIvj6SluAM0YzRGNZT0g5Snc&usp=sharing. While iPhone 6 and 6+'s camera has done better in the low light than LG G3, iPhone 6's camera captured completely blurred license plate numbers compared to the other 2 phones. That was embarrassing losing so much details. Samsung Galaxy S5 might have a better chance winning the low light test with iPhone 6 but the mountain picture shows the lack of details on the trees from iPhone 6's camera compared to LG G3's. I was able to see the differences from the phones and have another hiker who owned iPhone 6+ to verify them. The differences are more obvious if viewed on PC with large monitors. Not everything is bad about the camera, iPhone 6's camera actually did well capturing text in low light. Check the picture that has a yellow Chinese book. Zoom in and you'd see the text more clear than LG G3's. The file names tell you which picture belongs to which device. On the software side, Apple finally allow accessing iCloud data via iCloud Drive following what Google did years back. So it's playing catchup. However, my test of iCloud backup failed intermittently. Most of the iOS 8 features are following Google's Android 4.4 or barely matching it. Some people may think having a fingerprint sensor makes the device more secure. Definitely not. If fingerprint unlock fails, it reverts to PIN unlock. Anyone who knows possible PIN numbers can unlock your iPhone 6 by bypassing the fingerprint unlock screen. I found this because the fingerprint unlock worked 45% of the time on me. What could be more embarrassing if you use Apple pay but fails. I will for sure be the customer in line next to the failed Apple pay user yelling "get out, there are more people behind me trying to checkout". There are a few design decisions that make iOS 8 quite annoying. The most is mandatory password entry installing free apps. Android does not require that. One reason I can think of may be Apple does not want user to forget Apple ID's password. I've seen Android users fail to remember its Gmail password. Those dump ones are not using Google's string service back end and are usually the victims of converting to buying iPhones. The other less annoying design decision is that it requires user touching OK for "[App] would like to access your [location/photo/etc…]". I had to touch OK at every prompt. I can't think of practical uses of not allowing the app to do its functionality. If you don't trust the app, maybe you should not have downloaded it. I've seen a user choosing not allow for Google search/maps resulting in find a Starbucks 1000 miles away (useless search result). The user was misled that someone was trying to snoop on her. Android takes a different approach showing users the access permissions at app download time. Which eliminates the needs to asking users for permission at each turn. I believe the true price for iPhone 6 should be $400, not $650. The screen to body ratio is another sign of inferior hardware engineering. The top part of the phone from the edge of the screen to the top end measured in length is wider than LG G3. Such length is even wide on iPhone 6+. Apple should have pushed the screen edge to the top end  of the phone. Such tiny space could only allow putting a speaker and a front camera. LG G2, G3 did it. But Apple failed. Remember Apple bought the IPS LCD screen from LG and have Foxconn assemble it. The pixel resolution for iPhone 6 is 720p, 6+: 1080p, LG G3: 1440p

I wish it was slightly bigger, but the 6 Plus is too big.,Dust Storm (aka Haboob),5,This review is for the iPhone 6 (4.7”) phone. I bought my iPhone through Apple and it is not the unlocked version (it is tied to AT&T), so I am just reviewing the phone itself.First of all, I have owned every iPhone since the 3G. I currently am using the iPhone 6 Plus, but my wife has the iPhone 6 and I use it extensively also.I bought the iPhone 6 Plus and 6 on launch day. I did extensive research and comparing different factors to make the decision of which iPhone to buy. Like I mentioned, I personally chose the iPhone 6 Plus and knowing what I know now, I wish I would have bought the iPhone 6.The iPhone is noticeably larger than the iPhone 5/5s, both wider and taller. It is also significantly and noticeably thinner. As you can read and tell from photos, the design of the body is also completely different with the iPhone 6. Another major difference this year is the read camera actually protrudes from the back of the phone. This is because the phone is so thin, the camera components literally could not fit within the thickness of the phone body. I personally do not mind this because I have a case on my iPhone 6. But, if you do not have a case, then you will notice the phone "wobble" when it is on a flat surface. Although the lens is also made of sapphire, you do run the risk of scratching or damaging this camera if you are not careful.The rest of the features, such as speed, graphics, display, etc., is all incremental from the iPhone 5s and its not THAT noticeable. In fact, I actually have an iPhone 5s as a work phone, and I have compared it to the iPhone 6 by opening the same apps, loading the same webpages, etc., and occasionally the 5s actually beats the iPhone 6.My wife and I are heavy photo users with the iPhone 6, and one thing that you can tell is better is the picture quality with the iPhone 6. Additionally, the call quality and sound is definitely noticeable both from your end, and the person who you are calling (the first phone call we made on the iPhone 6 was to my mom, and she said "what are you calling me from? You sound so much clearer than normal."If you have a family or just naturally take a lot of photos, I would recommend that you upgrade to the 128gb model. Because the photo quality is better, the file size is larger so it takes up more space. Add in music, movies, and apps, you can run out of space quickly.Ultimately, the iPhone 6 is the most amazing iPhone yet and you definitely will not be sorry you purchased it. If you are torn between the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, I honestly would recommend the 6. I am a 280b, 5'11" man, and I think the iPhone 6 Plus is just too massive for your hand, pockets, etc.
Five Stars,Steve,5,I love the camera on this thing. The slow motion is really smooth. Here's a sample: http://youtu.be/NojspTnbRAo
Five Stars,Jesus Jimenez,5,all good Excellent Product!!
16 GB in 2014?,mph,1,This would have been a great phone, had Apple not been so stingy on the memory. This is 2014. Memory is so cheap - you can get a 64 GB micro SD card for under $30 - the base model of this phone should be 64, NOT 16 GB. 16 gigs is essentially enough only for the operating system and a hand full of photos and apps, not enough for a music library. Just an underhanded way for Apple to squeeze more money out of consumers.
Five Stars,Danielle Harmon,5,It a great product,thanks to apple
Excellent .,Samuel Yagub,5,Very good.
Not in love,Arisa Bush,3,I was so excited to buy my first iPhone (I have the 6)... And well I definitely miss my GS5. I'm not saying iPhone isn't a good phone; it just isn't Amazing. It is fluid, solid; but basic. Great for older adults who aren't very tech savvy. I feel as though I switched from a Benz to a top of the line Toyota lol iTunes and the finger print scanner are awesome. I mean it's instant! Much better than S5. However; not many features for camera. No split screen for multi-tasking; which I used very much on my GS5. Email seems to have not progressed for Apple. I can compare because I've had iPads. It is just very generic. Sound quality while talking is a bit muffled. No option to decrease volume of touch sounds without decreasing volume of phone overall. These are things I've noticed after having this phone for 2 weeks. Maybe I'll learn to love it over the next 2 years.

Apple fans, try a different phone and see what you are missing,YZ,1,I'll never buy another iPhone until Apple adds a "BACK" button.I've owned iPhones and Android phones. While a lot can be said of the nice features of iPhone, the lack of a "Back" button shows how stupidly arrogant Apple is and how it's sacrificing user experience for its bloated ego. Android and Windows mobile operating systems both have the "Back" button for a reason - the Back button is the easiest, most often used and most natural way to navigate in almost all apps. Apply doesn't add this function for no other reason than it doesn't want to admit it needs to learn a thing or two from others. There is Back button in iPhone Safari browser and some other apps, but each app may have this function at a different location, so users have to look for it each time. A Back button built into the operating system as in Android and Windows is obviously more convenient and natural. But Apple's ego is too large to go "Back" to fix this issue. Again, that's STUPIDLY arrogant. I'll never buy another Apply product until it learns a little modesty and make its product better for customers, not its ego!- Update in response to a comment from another user on my reviewThe user (obviously an Apple fan) said that all iPhone apps have some sort of "Back" function tied to the iOS navigation requirement. But that's exactly the problem. Each app builds the "Back" function differently, and the location varies from app to app. In Android and Windows, the Back button is always conveniently at the bottom of the phone, so one-hand operation is easy and natural. But on iPhone, even before the larger iPhone 6, it's almost impossible to easily navigate with one hand. And one simple touch to go "Back" in Android and Windows usually requires two or more moves. The really sad thing about iPhone is a commercial product turned into a religion. Apple fans blindly follow it without any rational thinking. I'm definitely not saying Android is perfect, but if Apple can't add a convenient, natural navigation function (which is obviously easy for it to do), it says something about its mentality. Apple fans may feel proud of all the tricks in navigating iPhone, but isn't iOS supposed to be the most intuitive and simple to use? Think of another difference between iPhone and Android phones. In Android, users can either set display brightness to "auto", or manually adjust it. In iPhone, iOS automatically adjusts the brightness, users have no choice. Apple fans would say iOS makes it simple so users don't need to adjust it. Android also has the default "auto" feature so users don't need to adjust it. But the difference is Android gives users the choice just in case users need to. And you know what? The universe has so many possibilities that some time the auto brightness doesn't fit a particular situation! Apple regards itself to be the master of the universe, while Android and Windows know there are limitations to whatever geniuses can foresee.All I'm trying to say is, if you love iPhone, love it rationally, at least look what's out there in the wider world and make an informed decision.
Recommend!,Grazvydas,5,I love it!
Iphone 6 Pro's and Con's,daniel,4,I recently  bought the iphone 6 gold and it has both Pro's and Con's .Pro's: *Bigger screen makes it more comfortable to use*Camera is substantially better than previous Iphone*Speaker are also a lot louder.Con's : *Earbud jack does not go all the way in and falls out a lot which makes it hard to listen to music.*Some times apps shutdown randomly.Overall I would recommend buying this phone.

I currently happily own a 15" top of the line Retina Macbook Pro and previously owned the original iPhone, 3gs, and iPhone 4 before switching to Android with the Nexus 4.While the Nexus 4 served me quite well and could have much longer, I decided to look into & test all of the latest new phones on the market, including the iPhone 6, before deciding to buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 which so far I think is really awesome!I think the Note 4 is the best phone I've ever owned and I don't miss the closed enviroment of the iPhone, requiring frequent jailbreaks if you want to break out of the jailed environment, but even worse in my opinion is the iPhone 6 comes with just 1GB of RAM!Even my 2 year old Nexus 4 had 2GB of RAM and my new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 comes with a whopping 3GB of RAM, with expandable storage of up to an extra 128GB via a micro-sd card, making it easy to store more files and play that data with ease!While the iPhone 6 will serve those who want a pretty phone or the technology challenged well (who still may use a VCR that flashes 12:00 all the time), but for anyone who wants a powerful phone that's not 2 years behind you should buy a better phone!

iPhone 6 is The Best iPhone Apple Have Ever Released,James Thomas,5,So let’s get down to what matters right? Specs, specs and more specs! Plus what’s new and why we should even think about upgrading from our iPhone 5s.1: Size: The dimensions and weight of course matter; unless you don’t mind carrying around a brick the size of trailer. The iPhone 6 comes in at 5.44 x 2.64 x 0.27 inches & weighing in at 4.55 oz. which of course is a bit larger than my 5s. This should help out some of us with slightly larger hands, but still have a nice grip and feel for all around daily use, ease of navigation and just general accessibility.2: RETINA HD DISPLAY: Having shatter proof glass is definitely necessary, unless you plan on keeping your iPhone 6 in the retail box- never holding it and making phone calls on speaker phone for the rest of your life. Yes, it’s upgraded from my old 5s Retina display to the RETINA HD DISPLAY! So why is it better you ask? With a Retina HD display, you better know the screen is delivering higher contrast and way better color accuracy, which all plays out as just an all around incredible display. Not to mention a bigger screen at 4.7’’ vs my iPhone 5’s 4.0’’ and higher resolution compared to the 5s, with the 750 x1334 (750p resolution) and a 1400 contrast ratio. Another added feature that is pretty slick is the dual-domain pixels for wider viewing angles, so when I’m showing my friend something, I don’t have to have to reach out and aim my phone directly in front of their face.3: NFC support: Now apparently we will only be able to use NFC capabilities with Apple pay for now, which allows me to make touch-less payments in stores and stuff, which I think is incredibly cool and futuristic. Now I know some will complain as to why all the capabilities aren’t functional, and no one truly knows except for Apple, but apparently the particular NFC chip has more capabilities beyond just Apple Pay. Apparently at an Apple event, the watch unlocked a hotel room, so I guess these are just some of the possibilities that this particular NFC chipset holds. So even though I have to wait a bit to use the NFC fully, I’m sure the wait will be well worth it in the long run.4: Speed: Using the Apple A8 chipset and a Dual Core 1.4 GHz Cyclone, compared to the iPhone 5’s 1.3 Ghz, we’re getting a speed boost to keep up with multi-tasking and if you’re like me constantly on your phone, working, gaming, and texting and have 100 apps open at the same time, then you know how much speed is a factor. Since it’s using the A8 chipset, this literally allows for 50% increased performance for graphics and 25% faster processing.5: Battery: The new battery on iPhone 6 is 50% more efficient. Though I haven’t run it through extreme testing as of yet, I’m already noticing a difference right out of the box and playing with it for a few hours.6: Camera: The new iSight camera is upgraded using a 8MP camera at 1.5µ pixels and 2.2 aperture. Although it doesn’t come with Optical Image stabilization like the Plus does, it’s still definitely worth the upgrades that are provided on the 4.7’’.A few others feature’s worth mentioning:Support for 3rd-party keyboards – This is elaborated on below (so check out the rest of my review under Quicktype keyboards)Improved face detection on iSight Camera - Which recognizes faces incredibly faster, while improving smile and blink detecting for overall better photos of you and with friends. I haven’t had a chance to take it with a group to test it yet, but at least it’s got this cool feature either way.Improved HDR photos and videos – The few new photos I’ve already taken have a noticeable difference compared to my 5S. I put them side by side to test and if I can notice the difference at a quick glance, then I’m happy with the upgrade and improvementsImproved video recording at 1080p @ 60 fps – Doing slo-mo is kind of funny just for messing around. I’ve only tested one video with our Cat on his “catnip” running around the house and rolling around on the floor and it definitely gave us a good laugh. The real thing I’m interested in but haven’t tested yet is the time-lapse video, being able to catch a sunset or moon rising within a few seconds on video is probably one of the coolest features for editing later or just making fun videos.Cloud Photo backup pricing varies – I get up to 5GB free, which is more than enough for me with photos and a few videos I want to keep around for a bit. If I ever need to upgrade the pricing below gets me more space on the backup.20 GB 99 cents per month200 GB $3.99 per month500 GB @ $9.99 per month-1 TB @ $19.99 per monthBeyond all the specs of the 6, there’s always that question…. “Why do I use an iPhone ?Performance on the iPhone has always been a major factor. The iOS system consistency offers stellar performance and rarely ever experiences major performance issues. Now with the iOS 8 update that happened on 9/17, which is expanding features and finally giving us more functionality. Some of these key features are a nice addition to my daily use.-Messages: The fact I can now easily share my location with my girl or friends, when we want to meet up somewhere is sweet. Plus it giving me the ability to add a video instantly to my messages makes this a super cool feature-Sharing with family: Now I can share the stuff I’ve purchased from iTunes or even the app store with family. Some of the app’s I’ve paid for are relatively expensive, and when my brother likes one of the apps, instead of him having to buy it, I can just share it with him! I think this is pretty generous on Apples part, allowing me use this with my fam.-Interactive Notifications: Which is now allowing us to swipe our iMessage or text message notifications to open them quickly and reply instantly back. Now I don’t have to open or leave the app, which was kind of annoying at times. I want things on the go and on the fly and I’m glad this new feature was added.-Quicktype Keyboard: Even though the iOS 8 update improved the keyboard functionality, it is now allowing for 3rd party keyboards to be used. The word prediction is also another nice update, which should help us out with the darn auto-correct problems. Though the update has fixed most of the auto-correct problems, it’s still better having more options than none.-Adding extensions: This is something that definitely helps me keep things going when I need to check for updates on the fly. The widgets and extensions aren’t limited anymore, since the iOS 8 update has now expanded to online services! They will sit only in the notification center, but this helps with unnecessary battery drain and extra mess on my screen.-Photo editing: I can now edit and or update my photos directly from Camera roll once I’ve snapped a picture, instead of having to enter into VSCO Cam. That used to annoy me, because I wanted to just snap a photo, edit it and send it quickly. Now with this new feature it’s finally possible and makes life easier if you’re a “food picture” taking freak like me.-The Continuity feature: This is something I’m seriously looking forward to. Basically the integration with my Mac or tablet will allow me to answer phone calls on either, or even answer text instead of having to pick up my iPhone. From what I hear, I can literally swipe documents from my phone or iPad directly to a computer or vice versa. My Mac is connected to my TV, so if I can literally swipe my Netflix app onto my Mac which is connected to the TV while I’m on the couch, then this function is seriously freaking cool.In a long story short. I love my iPhone 6 and with the ease of use, literally being able to do everything with one hand, the iPhones durability and with the hugest assortment of apps on the market. I don’t really have any complaints as of now, besides some small ones that are going to get fixed anyway. Even if I do have an issue, their grade A+ customer service is always there to help me out as quickly as they can.Overall… with my new iPhone 6 and the update to the iOS 8 it’s a serious upgrade and with the iOS system in general you know it’s going to be stable, which is why we even use iPhone in the first place!

Great deal,Loriel N. Johnson,5,Basically brand-new iPhone 6 64 GB for the price of the iPhone 6 16 GB. So far this phone works great it doesn't seem to have any problems item arrived in the condition it was described as and it came faster than it was supposed to. I will stay to check the warranty because the warranty he had listed was for phone support but the warranty to take the phone into the store to fix it does not expire until next year which is great.

Also using the phone in other countries is no issue!This is my 2nd iPhone , coming from an iPhone 5.I'm an Apple enthusiast so this was an obvious choice for me.It is fast opening and closing apps, websites, etc. but not a huge difference to make me suggest to hurry up and buy it.I only got an iPhone 6 because my daughter was in need of her first iPhone, so it made sense to give her my old iPhone 5.The screen response is perfect and the thumb print works 100% of the time and is really convenient to get into the phone.

Five Stars,rafael,5,Great phone.Nice and big, lots of memory. Heats up fast,Nick Zoe,4,OK, the transfer between the old and new iphone wasn't as easy as I hopeed. Everything got across but an old email kept popping up as my primary itunes email. No idea why.  The phone itself is nice compared to the 5S but you will need to get used to holding or putting this larger phone in your pocket.  It's runs faster (I guess because it's new)  but it also heats up fast when downloading.  Battery life seems iffy and the phone is very warm to the touch. I need to figure out how to turn off certain Apps.  It's a worthwhile upgrade, especially from a 5 or 4s. If you have a 5s you can still hold off for a while.

If you like frustration you'll love this phone...,Dash Beardsley "Dash Beardsley",1,If you enjoy frustration you will LOVE this cellphone. I could start with the price which is way to high for this piece of #%^%!It doesn't work any better than the 5s  even though it has many more gigs! It still locks up and I clear it all the time to get it to work! Also I DL a song from ITunes which is paid for but STILL not in my song list! I called apple and got 4 hours of conversation and at the end you might think a small problem like that that would be solved??? No, I was told someone would call me back....I'm still waiting its been 2 weeks!!!! The camera is ok on this phone. Though it's very grainy. DO NOT WAISTE YOUR HARD EARNED $ ON THIS PHONE! I PAID FULL PRICE THINKING IT WAS REALLY GREAT! Don't be fooled by the hype. Most of my friends have switched from Iphone to Android and love them. I have not done this yet so I can't really from experience there. It's AMAZING to me this phone is worth a 5 star rating? Really? People are easily duped and go for ANYTHING that is on TV. IF providers and cellphone companies were honest they would give you a trial run instead of contracts! APPLE: GET IT TOGETHER!
Great phone.  But annoying that the battery life is just one day.,doctornewyork,4,Great phone.  Only complaint I have is that I had it charged 100% midday yesterday and the same time today it's running really low.  With all of the technology out there today, is it really that difficult to make a battery that lasts longer than a single day?  This review is not to be a comparison to other devices; i.e., I'm not saying I have any other device in mind that has a better battery life, but with regard to this product in isolation, you have to consciously think about having your charger on you if you'll be spending the night somewhere.  Always hoping to rely on someone else's cord isn't practical.But yeah, you won't be unhappy with this phone otherwise.  Great device.
Five Stars,karolina,5,wow

Switched from the 5S Gold and Couldn't Be Happier,Jamie,5,I debated for a long time if I should go ahead and upgrade from the 5s to the 6. After a week of owning it I'm so glad I did, but there are some things you need to consider before making the switch.First of all the biggest difference is the size of the phone. It actually feels lighter (it's thinner) but the screen is much larger. It took me a few days to get used to navigating the larger screen size with one hand, but it can be done. It still fits perfectly in my pocket or purse so that has been a non issue and I'm actually liking the larger screen size. It definitely enhances FaceTime.I also upgraded from 16gb on my 5s to 64gb on the 6 because I got sick of running out of room. If you make the choice to buy the 6, go with at least the 64gb of storage as it's not a huge price difference but a LOT more storage.It also synced right up with my iPad so if I'm reading or using my tab I can decline or answer calls and reply to texts from my tab as well as my phone.If you are getting gold or silver or whatever because you like the color of the phone, I suggest getting a Moshi case to match your phone. They have cases here on Amazon by Moshi that will protect your iPhone 6 without taking away from the color.Other than the screen size and the storage I upgraded, there's not a big difference between this and the 5s, but even then I do love the new design. Now if you're upgrading from just a 4 or regular 5, you'll love the Touch ID and other perks. If you're an iPhone lover, this one will not disappoint. If you use Android, this phone may be the one that converts you to the iPhone. I have two family members who were die hard Samsung fans and they are now changing to the iPhone 6 after seeing mine.

Functionally Unacceptable,Sandy Gardener "Sandy",2,I've owned a number of phones, but never an Iphone. All my relatives own Iphones though, and two of them have 6's. What I've noticed is that three primary functions of the Iphone 6's, phone, camera, and storage,  are of noticeably inferior quality compared to my old Nokia Lumia 520 ($40)and  my new dual sim unlocked Nokia 530 ($80).Phone: The call sound quality on the 6's is HORRIBLE compared to the Nokias, regardless of location. The primary purpose of a phone is to make calls, right? I often make my relatives hang up and call on their land lines. It's that bad. My wife is a flight attendant, and calls home from all over the US on the Nokia 520. The call quality is usually better than land line. I'm not exaggerating in either case.Photos: We go on vacation to Yosemite with the relatives. They're shooting photos with their 6's, us with our 520's, at the exact same times and locations. The photos get uploaded to Facebook. Across the board, the Iphone photo's are of substantially inferior quality to the Nokia photo's. I think this may have something to do with the thickness of the phones, and what that does to the lens design.  I've seen a number of articles on the Internet comparing and touting Iphone photo quality. All I know is what what I actually see myself.Storage: OK, this is no secret. There's no SD card slot on Iphones. You pay through the nose up front, or you're stuck. Our Nokia's have micro SD card slots just like other phones.I really don't get it. People literally pay ten times the money for a product that doesn't perform it's most basic functions satisfactorily. Yes, I know, there's all these wonderful apps available for the Iphone, and Iphones are so slim and sexy. I'll take the sound and photo quality of the Nokia.

Iphone review,Johnby,4,The iPhone 6 works perfectly well. I usually get androids but I wanted to try something new. The only downside is the battery life other than that it is really good. Another thing I would recommend getting more memory if you like to have music a lot of pictures and a lot of videos. I seem to always have too much memory in the storage. The iPhone 6 is really good because of the simplicity unlike android. If you want a simple easy to use phone that is quite stylish I would get this phone. The camera is really good as well and apple provides many good apps.

Completely disapointed,carlos henrique barros,1,Everything about the phone seemed fine at first inspection the exterior was brand new. However, the audio function was a problem from the first call I made. It was impossible to hear the caller nor could I speak to the caller. This was true in the both iPhone and speaker function. Because of the audio issue, the phone is unable to record voice messages or shoot videos with any audio recorded. Additionally, the iPhone 6 has also shut down on its own several times without any prompting. You can imagine my frustration when I'm unable to hear or speak to my friends, family and business associates.I've tried to reboot/restart the iPhone a few times. I've also reset and restored the phone and it doesn't seem to remedy the situation.

Finally a size that is arthritis friendly...,Pelican Freak,5,I am loving this phone - I am coming to it from an iPhone 5s and several other older versions of the iPhone before it. The previous models were a bit uncomfortable - I am severely arthritic and lately it's gotten into my hands. This one is much more comfortable to hold and manipulate.Of course it's really pretty too which doesn't hurt anything. Is sturdy, I am forever dropping this thing / having it fall, etc and I do not have it in an Otterbox, but just a basic, clear case so I can admire it's beauty.  Super easy to use like all iOS devices.Gorgeous picture with the retina display that cannot be found on smaller devices , yet doesnt need bigger than this. A perfect size. I wouldn't want to go any bigger, but smaller was just getting painful.

This phone is pretty easy to use but,Becky LeBeau,2,This phone is pretty easy to use but...these are the issues I have with it. It doesn't have enough space. Can't have many pictures or apps. I have to keep deleting things or the camera doesn't work. Every time I upgrade it downloads another app that I don't want or need and I can't delete it. I don't have an apple watch! Why would I need the app? Also when I charge the phone in any car the radio gets fuzzy. It also uses data when I'm connected to WIFI! I'm a new mother of twins. I sometimes don't get out of the house for days at a time but I'm getting text messages saying "you have used 75% of your data". How? Verizon blames Apple. They say the phone uses data even if you are connected to WIFI. I only work the weekends! I thought 3 GB would be enough since I'm connected to WIFI 5 out of 7 days. guess not!

GPS drains about 10% of battery per hour,MK,1,Decent phone, but stay away from it if you intend to travel.1) The GPS app is a power hog. Drains about 10% of battery/hr2) Does not work (yes, even though it is marked as unlocked) in India. I tried airtel, vodafone and few other simmsAs a general advice : buy directly from Apple/Amazon as opposed to a third party seller.

This version doesn't work with many providers.,JA,2,Careful! Read the description carefully. Canadian version of "unlocked" doesn't work with many U.S. Providers. The whole reason to spend more for unlocked is to switch providers at will.
Perfect and on time,Flavia,5,We received the product on time and it was impecable, we have not activated it yet but I can asume it it unlocked as the description specified when I bought it.
Great phone, with moderate battery life, and great usability.,Ali Ashraf,4,Apple UI is hard to beat as far as ease of use, and simplicity. The phone does everything I'd like it to. Battery life is not the greatest. Screen size was something of a worry for me, since I thought that the iPhone 5/5s screen size was perfect for me. I got used to it real quick, and now it doesn't bother me at all.

Euro plug power adapter, not USA!,Lawrence C.,2,Actually, the phone itself is perfect and worthy of 5 stars. Unlocked and ready to go. In fact, I'm happy because I was able to just pop my AT&T SIM card in and it worked! Before buying the phone, I stopped in at my local AT&T store to ask if I would have a problem using an unlocked iPhone with my SIM. They said no, but led me to believe I would have to take the phone in to be activated. I don't know why they said that.I'm giving 2 stars because the power adapter plug in the box is European type, and I don't see anywhere in the description that it is a non USA power adapter. It's not a problem for me as I travel to Europe often and would need to use a plug adapter anyway. But, for those who absolutely need a USA power adapter, beware!

So Sorely dissappointed with Apple, I can't even Say...,Jake,1,After finally throwing-in the Towel on Android I was very excited to get my new iPhone 6. I was tired of the horrific battery length in my Samsung SII's and SIII's (mainly due to dozens of Apps running in the background without your Permission.) Also, almost impossibility of accessing any of your files on the device without a Third-Party App. Also, the frightening permissions that you must agree to in order to Install anything. Also, the finickyness of Android to want to install to any device if it doesn't "think" that it may be compatible, or the frustration in installing to more than one device, or to a non-standard, or off-brand Android device. Mostly to the poor batterySo, I was so excited to try out my new iPhone 6. But, the Love-Affair lasted only less than a day, and started dwindling quickly, after day 1. The battery is Excellent, when compared to the previous Android versions. It charges relatively quickly, and stays charged. I found Facetime to be a nice Bonus that I wasn't expecting. That's where the good part ends. You will despise the nightmarishly small buttons, such as the "Send" button, if you are converting-over from any other Phone. The Permissions may possibly be far Worse than even Androids' scary permissions...you have to put all your Credit Card # on file, and they even warn you that this is dangerous, and you have to use Safety features that (supposedly) safeguard your Credit Card # and Personally Identifiable Information...but, it would be better if you didn't have to provide this information in the First Place. It doesn't have the same problem as the Android, whereas if you've been put on hold for two hours, and suddenly your call is connected you're keypad would time-out and you would be S.O.L. ("outta-luck"), and have to call back, and wait on hold for another couple of hours. That was exceptionally-annoying. Thanks for nothing Android. The file management is only slightly better than Android's pathetic file-management system (or, complete & total Lack Thereof.) I'm not entirely sure how to use all of the 64 Gb of Memory on this Apple, unless, all you do is take pictures and nothing else.In addition to Apple iPhones' god-awfully Tiny, Puny pathetic buttons that unless you're a petite third-grade girl you will be incredibly frustrated with. Let's hope you don't have Fat Fingers, or you're Completely outta-luck with Apple, Sorry. If you ever try to cut-and-paste a combination of numbers and letters or symbols, such as a Password for example, from a Text file you will drive yourself quite literally insane and will have to have yourself committed. In fact, you will NEVER be able to copy-over that symbols/letters/numbers from a Text file. It. just. isn't. possible. Missing are many of the function-Keys that you may have been accustomed-to, on your Android. The camera is Stellar, and you can do some cool functions with your Photos. It seems to tell you what "it" thinks you want for all your buttons, at the bottom, and, as far as I know, this is not customizable. It also tells you what it wants to be on your desktop Screen, and dumps a bunch of Random icons there, for your deleting pleasure. The most embarrassing thing about the iPhone, is if you press on a person's name, it will Automatically CALL them, even if it's 1 or 2 in the morning, and all you wanted to do, was Edit the details. Beware of This!!! until you get used to Apples' Style of telling you what to do, or what It thinks You want to do!! Incorrectly, as it is. The requirements of installing the bloatware known as iTunes to your Computer is a minor annoyance. A HUGE problem is that apple iPhones' will Continuously nag you to install or Update apps, even if you don't want to. It's all-or-nothing, apparently, with Apple. Sucks, I know.... All you want to do is use your phone, and you have to keep clicking these annoyances, to get rid of them. Sure, you can turn the whole thing off, but you may not necessarily want to do That, either. So, you are forced to compromise, if you want to own an Apple.The most insanely-Stupid and beyond frustration thing about the Apple is it is the ONLY phone in our Nation's history to not allow speed-dial programming of your number keys. Not something you would AT ALL expect from a phone, certainly one that costs Several hundred dollars.Even the Cheapest phone I can possibly find, that was made-and-assembled in China, allows for programming of the number keys!!!! How Embarrassing this must be for Apple! If I was on the board-of-directors, I would be Truly Ashamed. Sure they have a couple work-around's, including some weird Circles, placed ALL THE way at the top of the Screen. These oddly-place round circles are devoid of any Color, and have people's full Intitials creepily put on them, rather than any kind of picture icon or colorful symbol that you would expect from any company in the Twenty-First Century. This oddly-insisted-upon quirk puts Apple technology WAY back past cheap Chinese phones that are decades old. I thought that, naturally, a Several-hundred dollar phone would have such features as a programmable number keypad as Standard. But, unfortunately, if you invest in this Pricey technology, you will find out this is NOT the case, at least not with Apple.So, if you want to pay several hundred dollars for a Prehistoric phone then Apple is for you.
Five Stars,Kyle B.,5,Perfect phone. Came unlocked as advertised. Put in my Cricket SIM card without any problems.
New iPhone, old iPhone problems,R Frost.,1,New iPhone old iPhone problems,  I read reviews on Amazon and other shopping sites all the time, sometimes they help me in my buying decisions, and sometimes they don't,  I do hope this will help you make your buying decision.  I'll try to make this short and sweet,  this iPhone has an extraordinarily  then case, it bends easily just like the 6+, the camera protrudes from the case, you don't think of this being a problem until you set the phone down and try to play a game or text somebody,  The wobbling of the phone is very annoying, being an electrician I pay a great amount of attention to detail, especially in the charging system, or electrical cords, I love the iPhones lightning cord technology it's outstanding, however these phones cost $800 and up,  and the cord you receive is extremely short, and poorly made, The screen technology falls short in comparison to a lot of the newer technology out there, Samsung, LG,  and others,  they need to understand what true high-definition really means. The battery life in these phones are actually going downhill, as far as this area is concerned, the battery life on the newer generation  iPhones are getting worse not better, that is a fact, the batteries become completely  useless  after 8 to 9 months of use, and then are extraordinarily expensive to replace, if you're able to do so at all, here is the biggest issue, and let me remind you once again these phones start at $800,  when you upgraded your iOS operating system, it always slows down your phone, and eventually making the phone completely obsolete, you can tell the usual signs, the phone crashes and goes back to the homepage, lots of chop when you surf the Internet, and you have to clear your memory and cookies constantly,  I work on iMac computers all day long, however i'm at the point now that I'd rather not use an iOS driven device,  just so you understand these are genuine concerns, they're making the phone look very pretty,  however do they still have the short cord after all these years, why yes they do,  understand this has been there largest consumer complaint, that and the fact that these phones will not hold onto a Wi-Fi signal, this has been a huge problem and still exist today in nearly all of their models,  before making a  purchase, I would highly recommend you background the phone on the Internet,  and find out what's really going on with these devices,  I love Apple products, and I thought Steve Jobs was truly a genius  however, Mr. Cook has  most certainly drop the ball.

We've been waiting for a larger screen to keep up with technology and this phone does all that and more. Battery life is good. If I were to go back I'd get the 64GB just for future proofing, but honestly, since I can sell it whenever I like, I didn't think it would matter much. Also got a Spigen case for it from day one to help keep its value.

The screen breaks so easily.,f.gibbs2989,3,I’ve gone through my fair share of iphones. I used to have the 3g, 4g, and 5.  Now I have moved onto the 6 and I dropped it one time and bam the screen shattered. I dropped all my other iphones from higher levels onto hard floors and they would never shatter, but the 6 did. I feel as though apple should be making their phones built to last. If I have to pay that much money for a phone I would expect it to at least have some kind of resilience to breaking when it’s dropped. I know they offer a warranty, but that is even more money tacked onto the $700 I am already paying. To me something selling for such a high price should be more impressive and durable.
Four Stars,Joseph Okechukwu,4,Phone is wider than I had expected.
a BAD PHONE with lots of bells and whistles but still a lousy phone,Ted K "duraflex",1,It's a LOUSY PHONE.It may have a beautiful display and all kinds of connectivity and bells and whistles - BUT as a PHONE - it's just bad - really bad.I have worked with many realtors who use these iphones and they all sound like crap.  When possible, I usually wind up asking them to call me back FROM a land line. When they do, I can hear them perfectly whether I am on my Motorola flip phone, my wife's cheapo Samsung cell phone or our hard-wired ATT land line.Really, it may be a really expensive hand held computer that does all kinds of tricks, but as phone to TALK to other people, it cannot even match the quality of cell phones I had 15 years ago.

Absolutely love this phone but there is one drawback...,Gillian Herrle,4,Ok, in general I am obsessed with the design of this phone. When the iPhone 6 came out, we all thought the size was a little bit big - but I absolutely love having a larger screen! It makes watching videos, using Instagram and editing photos SO much more enjoyable! My one drawback to this phone, which is pretty major in my opinion, is how the camera lens protrudes from the back of the phone. Basically, without a case, your phone is sitting right on the camera when it is set down. This is ridiculous to me. It took me a few weeks to decide on which case I wanted to purchase for my iPhone 6 and by the time I decided on the Lifeproof case, my camera had cracked. Overall I am in love with my iPhone 6; I absolutely love the new design and adore the gold color which is super classy and beautiful. However, Apple really dropped the bomb by not protecting the lens more on a $1000 phone. I'm bummed by the fact that I have this amazing phone that now has a cracked camera.

my thoughts on iphone,Corinne Sefcik,4,I wasnt sure about buying the iphone because for one, its the expensive, and two, andriod phones have come a long way in features and apps. Its sometimes extremely hard to compare these phones, when it comes to battery life, pixel density, screen size and build quality. I used [...] to help me compare, and I would recommend checking this out if you are serious about buying an iphone or one of the samsung galaxy phones. The great thing about buying an unlocked phone is that you never have to worry about your contract again, and can switch carriers whenever you see a better deal elsewhere. Also using the phone in other countries is no issue!I hope this helps.

The iPhone 6 takes the best of what works for apple and brings it to a form factor that the masses want. Once you get used to the larger size, it's a great device. However, previous iPhone users beware: the size does take time to get used to. It's a larger device that makes one handed use more difficult.

A disappointment,John M.,3,I upgraded from a Samsung SIII to the iPhone 6.  I have found pluses and minuses with the iPhone, but I have been really disappointed with the basic functionality of the phone -- things that one would expect to be figured out after six iterations of the phone.First is that my phone, every now and again, shuts down for no apparent reason.  Plenty of battery power, but I pull out the phone and find out that it is off.  How many calls have I missed?  I find myself hauling the thing out every hour or so just to see if it's working.  (Apple's customer service has been useless about this.)Email is amazingly primitive.  The rest of the world figured out how to attach a file in 1985.  Apple is still working on it.The phone has all kinds of little tricks and gadgets on it, which are great, but they missed on the big things.

Best phone available in 2015!,Devon Miller,5,This phone, is by far the best phone I have ever had! I don't know where to begin, this iPhone is fantastic! TouchID makes everything easier, the camera is beautiful, this is a fast phone! I have used previous iPhone's but this is definitely the best of them yet! Came brand new sealed in the box, setup was painless. iOS 8.3 has a very user friendly interface, and it is a fast OS for a mobile device at that. The carrier I chose is Straight Talk. I put my SIM card in, called the number on my SIM activation kit, and was ready to go within 5 minutes! No additional effort was required on my part. Having iCloud made restoring all of my settings a breeze, and, if my phone ever breaks, I won't lose any data since iCloud makes a backup every time the phone is plugged in and connected to wifi! The battery on this is amazing! When it arrived, it was at 80%. I drained it down to 2% and plugged it in until 100% for the first charge. I have not charged it since, besides listening to music through USB in my car when driving, and it's been almost a week.The build of this phone is beautiful. I bought a waterproof case to keep it that way. I strongly recommend this phone if you like a user friendly, fast, reliable device that won't have a dead battery in a year like most other phones do.

Great phone. 5 stars,Rodni,5,Great phone I have ever had. nice design and long battery life. Easy to use, not complicated like android based phones.in love with my iPhone 6 :),Kimberly Enriquez,5,I have this same iPhone in 128 GB and I'm not even half with filling it up yet!Seriously love this iphone! I've had an iPhone pretty much since ever, I started with an android back in 2010 (my first phone and I was about 18 years old) but it was a piece of poop so I decided to buy an iPhone 4 in 2011, and I've been in love with it since then! But in 2013 I was like "oh what the heck, why not make a change? I'll just get an android" so I (was indeed stupid) traded my iPhone 4s at the time, with a galaxy s3 and boy did I regret it. It lagged and it was the worst camera I've seen! Now I understand that since it was 2 years ago, technology has become better but I still don't trust androids at all! I'm scared they'll let me down. And for s 2 year contract I don't wanna waste money. I love iPhones :) they're classic, beautiful and just amazing quality! #teamapple

Still waiting for my refund. issues about how this company gets these phones,jorge,5,Phone was in perfect visual shape. But for some reason the phone did not work properly. I had lines on the screen of the phone and it would freeze a lot. I took it to Apple Store and the serial # shows that the phone should have been in their warehouse. Somehow the phone I purchased through flipd was turned in to Apple for a replacement then sold to me through them

ANDROID PHONES ARE BETTER FOR BUSINESS and BETER FOR BRANDING,Stacy K.,2,OK, please tell me is I'm wrong on this, but one month ago, I switched from a Android (it was old, a Galaxy S3 with 16 GB of memory, and I was switching cell phone companies anyway) to the iPhone 6 64GB phone (not the "plus version" - too big for my needs).  I AM SWITCHING BACK to an ANDROID.  I wanted to be fair and give it 30 days, which I think should be enough time to test a lot of the basic features I would use every day.  I have been on this iPhone 6 10-12 hours a day for the past 30 days Emailing, texting, calling, Internet searching, photo-taking, etc.  My conclusion: for a business owner, the Android is MUCH better for the following reasons (and these are only the ones I've discovered in the past 30 days):1. On the Android, I was able to forward to my assistant, via text, any voicemails I didn't need to handle and text her a message saying "Could you please handle this?".  You can’t do this on the iPhone 6.  You can't even do it via Email unless you download an app.  After downloading this app and taking over an hour to set it up, I discovered that, when calling other people, the caller ID now does not show MY name or MY phone number.  It shows some other phone #, which may cause a client not to answer my call.  Also, building a brand is important to a business, and this caller ID issue is not good for branding.  So, I either have to live without forwarding voicemail messages (which is a huge time saver!!) or keep it and have some random phone number and name show up when I call others.  In the end, the functionality should just BE THERE in the first place and be easy to figure out like it was on the Droid.2. You cannot set up a default signature for a text.  In other words, with each text, on the Android, my message was followed by my name and my website.  Again - a great branding thing because my friends, family and business associates are reminded of what I do without me being in their face about it, but also, if a new client or prospect doesn’t have my contact info/phone number saved into their phone yet, this lets them know who is texting them and they might respond more quickly.  In addition, they might also consider visiting my website after seeing my default signature (what business doesn't want that?!).  I found out that you can set up a shortcut on the iPhone to MANUALLY add it at the end of each text, but I can’t remember to do it because I am BUSY and I don't think I should have to remember to do it.  It should just BE there.  Therefore, this is brand identity that I have lost with the iPhone.3. You cannot search the Internet when you're on an iPhone 6.  You CAN do this on the Droid.  I OFTEN search for things on the Internet while on the phone when a client has a question or one of my team members calls me and needs something.4. The iPhone 6 camera is NOT very good.  Photos are a core part of my business (and also my personal life) and the clarity of the photos on the iPhone 6 are not as good as my OLD Droid.  I thought maybe I could change the default size on the camera menu to a larger size (as you can do on the Droid) to improve the quality, but no iPhone user has been able to tell me how and I can't find it on the menus or the Internet.  To explain, when I take a photo and then zoom in on the photo, it is blurry.  Yes, BLURRY.  I previously had a Galaxy S3 (a pretty "old" phone) and you could zoom in on any object and the clarity would be fantastic when you zoomed in on the captured image.  As an example, when letters were too tiny on labels, I used to use the camera on that S3 phone to take a photo of the label and then I would zoom in I would be able to read it.  Can't do this with the iPhone 6.  With photos of people, it's the same thing.  What's up with this?  The other reviews I've read show that its clarity is not as good.  I really wish I'd done my research before just believing all the iPhone fans out there.  Apparently, they don’t know what they don’t have.5. The texting program is not intuitive.  On the Droid, it was very smart and intuitive.  It got used to words you used a lot and would automatically bring them up as default options and even correct your grammar very well.  The iPhone does not do this, even if I've typed the same word 200 times in 30 days (like my daughter's name, for instance).  The talk-to-text is also less accurate.  The Droid gets more and more accurate as it learns your speech patterns and pronunciations.  Also, when correcting my texts, tapping and holding where the incorrect spelling is and dragging it is much less efficient and requires more accuracy on the iPhone and also sometimes takes 3-4 attempts to even get it to recognize where I'm tapping.  It takes me 3x as long to type a text.  Not good in my business.  Also, the swipe-texting feature is delivered with the Droid – and I love this feature.  When I can’t voice-to-text because I’m in a quiet place, it helps me text more quickly that tapping the letters on the keyboard.  You apparently have to download the swipe-texting function for the iPhone  but I'm not even going to bother since I've wasted too much time trying to configure the phone and adapt to IT versus IT adapting to MY needs.  It's just too frustrating and time-consuming to download apps to fix things that should be there by default like the Droid.6. Working the iPhone 6 with one hand is much more difficult due to where the menu selections are.  It was much easier to use the Droid when only having one hand free.I was willing to cough up the exorbitant cost of the iPhone if it would save me time and if it was a much better experience, since I don't have a lot of time at this stage of my business and in many cases, “you get what you pay for”.  If I'm paying almost $800 for a phone (I don’t like contracts), I expect the same or better than the Droid, as all "die hard" iPhone users say it is.  What I am finding is that most iPhone users have only ever BEEN iPhone users and that they don't know what functionality they're not getting because they have always had an iPhone.  I wanted to enter into it with an open mind and judge it based on my experience and my needs.  Yes, there are probably things about the iPhone that are better than a Droid (not sure what yet), but for a business person whose priority is BRANDING, and considering the value for the money, this phone is definitely not for me.Again - PLEASE feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but after hours of searching, I have given up on finding answers to these issues.  I need to get back to building and BRANDING my business now...  I'm researching Android phone options now, but reviews and articles are pointing to the new Galaxy S6 or the Galaxy  Note 4 as the best phones for BUSINESS.  I don't care about the battery not being removable on the Galaxy S6 or that there is no Micro SD card slot (I'm buying a 64 GB version).  My fingers are crossed that I can get back on track with my business very soon after I switch back.

Nothing Innovative Here Folks, BUT...,Timbo Slice "Tim",5,I LOVE THIS PHONE!So Ill break it down for you guys. Im not the biggest Apple fan in the world. I do not own anything other than an iPhone. But I have been buying iPhones for 6 plus years (no pun intended). I've been a huge fan of the super user friendly iOS that they have on them. The phones have a lot of limitations. But for a phone, I would never complain. I will say the same thing I tell everyone who asks about iPhones and iPads and what have you, "The iPhone is a great phone, but if you want a tablet, go android." The android tablets defeat the iPad in every way I could possible imagine. Yet, I digress.Now onto the iPhone 6 itself. I purchased the space grey model with the 128gb hard drive. The very first thing I noticed with this phone was the screen. I wont go into the specifics of pixel density. The iPhone 6 does not have the highest. But the particular screen they used is what is called 5k (basically 4k but Apples name for it) and it just looks beautiful. The clarity it boasts puts not only previous iPhones, but other past phones to shame. Like it should right? Its a brand new phone. It should be a lot more innovative than any phone that came before it, right? Well, my answer to that is no, it doesnt. Apple took what we loved of the iPhone and just reused it in this phone. They improved a lot of the phones features, but once again, there is nothing that this phone offers that you could not find in other phones on the market today. But Im still loyal to the iPhone for its incredibly easy to use interface.Now the next thing that blew my mind with this phone is the camera and video recorder. I go to concerts a lot. And I love getting pictures of the bands while they are in action. I also love getting videos of my favorite songs so I can relieve those moments. Ive recorded a lot of videos with previous phones and the audio/video quality is just terrible. Until I got this phone. The camera has a new software added to it to allow it to keep focused much better than the previous phones. The same software is used in one of the newer Samsung phones as well, so once again, nothing new to the table. So when me and my friend are at a Blue Oyster Cult concert, we decided to see who's phone recorded better audio/video. He was using the Samsung Galaxy 5. His video was the same if not slightly better than mine. He could also zoom in much closer than I was able too. However, the audio on my videos kicked his phones butt up and down that stage. Anytime the drums would, be it bass pedal or cymbal, his phones audio would just clip. Meanwhile, my iPhone takes those louder noises in stride and produced the best video I've ever managed to record on a phone. Also, just to add a bit more, there was a short film shot entirely with an iPhone 6. Its a FPS romance film about two lovers living their day to day life in New York I do believe. I watched the trailer they had on Youtube for it a while back and the quality was really good. So kudos iPhone for filming a movie!They added some new apps to the iPhone when this phone came out. Though I do believe you can get those apps on the previous incarnations of the iPhone. The biggest thing Apple has been bragging about however is Apple Pay. Unlucky for me, I live in a smaller city that hasnt quite adapted to these "new fangled ways" of getting into dept, I mean shopping. So I havent gotten to try Apple Pay. Maybe one day soon though.So all in all guys, I love my iPhone 6. This phone however does not offer something that you couldnt find in another phone, except maybe the stupid high amount of memory you can get now. And for someone like me who loves having an easy to use interface and a bunch of memory (my phone is my iPod. Its just more convenient) then this phone would be a damn good choice. Apple could have put more features and made the phone much more unique, but I was happy with the changes they've made since the iPhone 5 and I just hope the iPhone 7 will give us features on our phones we never knew possible. Happy shopping fellows.

An Amazing Smart Phone. The best!!!,Filmorama "Filmorama",5,I LOVE this phone. It loads data quickly and everything works how it should. The screen size was the main reason why I wanted to upgrade - the other iPhone screens always seemed too small. (I didn't go for the 6 PLUS because I wanted the phone to comfortably fit in all my pockets, which this does.) I'm not someone who needs the highest HD resolution screen, so if that's an issue for you then I recommend checking out the iPhone 6 in a store so you can make sure the screen meets your needs.Otherwise, everything about this phone is awesome. I use Siri a lot to get directions and find the maps feature extremely helpful. If I take a wrong turn, it recalculates directions quickly. This is an impressive feature. The thumb print Touch ID is beyond helpful. I wasn't sure about using it at first, but now I can't imagine punching in the code each time - what a hassle that was! Also, I watch a lot of videos on my phone using my home wifi (no data use that way) and this phone streams video perfectly. It never even gets stuck when the video goes to commercials. this was sometimes a problem with other products.I'd like to add one little tip: Lower your brightness setting (just ask Siri to do it if you're lazy!). This will extend your battery life, and it's a little easier on the eyes, although I should add that the battery is very good. Have fun and enjoy your phone!
THE PHONES ARE NOT UNLOCKED,jasmine suarez,1,THIS IS NOT AN UNLOCKED IPHONE 6. THE PHONE IS LOCKED TO VERIZON. I suggest calling Apple to verify the IMEI to confirm where the phone is locked to because you will not be able to use it without it being unlocked to the original carrier first!

All good.,VE221520 alan atacho,5,Everything like it was supposed to. PerfectSatan Approved,Barnabus,5,So this was very effective in helping me communicate and get closer to my lord and savior, Satan. Now, before this, I had some sort of Android device. And while I was still able to communicate, the connection just was not as clear and pristine, and I didn't feel the emotional bond that I feel now. Not only is this a great device for communicating verbally, but it really does help you connect with those who are not quite human on a deeper level. He was able to use me as a vessel, getting in and out of my body in a cleaner and quicker manner through the iPhone, that other smart phones really just can't offer.
Oh Thank God for Apple!,David Batterson "David Batterson",5,Thank god for the iPhone! My first iPhone was the 4S and I had it for a couple of years. I never had one single problem with it. Then I ended up getting the Galaxy Note II when it first hit the market. It was like climbing out of a Bentley and getting into a Volkswagen.The fluidity of the overall function of the iPhone from navigating anywhere within the phone as well as its speed cannot be matched. When I went Android I lost all of that. True Apple lovers know what I'm talking about. The speed and fluidity of Apple products can't be touched! I was floored.After 3 years of lugging around a phone I never cared to even really learn how to use, I got the iPhone 6 and never looked back. As a matter of fact, the only bad thing I can say about this phone is that I wanted black and ended up with a gray one. But that really doesn't matter!

Coming Back to Apple,Mz. Medusa,5,I left the iPhone community because I wanted a bigger screen and was hooked by some of the flashy tech offered by the Android market.  I loved my S4, proudly showed it off.  Almost 6 months to the day of purchase, the phone started acting strangely.  It would reboot itself up to 17 times a day.  It would close apps randomly and open other apps.  The battery stopped holding a charge.  The micro USB port broke.  I started missing my iPhone because it simply worked, every time.  The iPhone 6 came out and it includes all the features I left Apple for.  I am so happy to be back.  I have the huge screen, it works every time and I have the best customer service available when I have any questions or issues.Five Stars,andres,5,everything perfect. Thank You. recommended seller

Awesome choice in a cellphone!!,MVorrath,5,I have gone from using a basic slider phone where I only had talk/text services through Sprint.  I had been eligible for a cellphone upgrade for over a year and was reluctant to go with a smartphone because I didn't want my monthly bill to jump.  In January I was at Best Buy browsing at the cellphones to see what was out there.  I was shocked to see that what I had been paying for that little talk/text phone through Sprint that I could have had unlimited talk/text/data for the same price.  Sprint has changed their individual plans to be more affordable.  Just about everyone in my family has an iPhone so I thought, "what the heck" I'll try the new iPhone 6.  I feel like I totally waited until the time was right and got the best deal ever!!  I TOTALLY love this phone!!Four Stars,srinu,4,Nice

The perspective from switching to iphone from android,Amircat1,5,So I made the switch from using Android to the iPhone back in October, and I've been using the iPhone 6 for the past few months now and can give a detailed review on what it's like to switch over. Before this switch, I've used the Samsung Galaxy S2 (first smartphone ever!) and also the Nexus 4. Since I'm a tech enthusiast, I'm well versed and have played around with many other Android devices, including all the big names, Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 and M7, One Plus One, and so on. Here are my thoughts:Things that the iPhone does really well (both hardware and software-wise):1. Camera. The behind the scene software for digitally capturing an image is definitely the strongest sell for the iPhone. Other than the S5 and Note 4, no smartphone really comes close to having the same kind of image quality (no matter the megapixels) compared to the iPhone. This was one of the reasons for me to switch over since I've started to dabble with photography and wanted a really good camera in my smartphone. (Side note, if you read a lot of tech blogs, there is a notion that in the near future our smartphones won't accurately describe our devices anymore since making a phone call is probably one of the least commonly used features on a smartphone when you look at any average user. Cameras, social media, emails all take a higher usage rate than making a call... really interesting, but anyway, back to the review).2. Reliability. There have been maybe 2 or 3 times when my phone crashed and would have to be restarted, mostly due to playing some game that was not written very well for the iOS devices. On Android devices, I've experienced a lot more crashes, and that may be due to the fact that so many apps haven't figured out the best way to optimize the app for each individual phone due to the fragmentation problems or something else. Either way, I feel like the iOS environment and hardware is more reliable in my everyday use.3. Fingerprint sensor. Once you've used it, you won't go back. The S5 is not that close yet in terms of usability with their sensor. The one in the iPhone 6 works really well. I definitely have found myself using my phone more because of how easy it is to unlock and install apps.4. Control of apps. This is an interesting point. In general, you get way more control over how to use and how to integrate your apps on Android than iOS. But in iOS, it's really interesting that you can control the kind of notification that gets sent to your phone, background refresh, location requirement, and access to certain things like photos and camera. In Android, you can do all of this as well, but sometimes for a lot of apps you have to have root access.5. Double tap to bring down the row of apps. I can't believe no one has thought of this before. A lot of Android phones have gigantic screens, but no one has really figured out how to best get the users to interact with that. You can tap the home button twice on the iPhone to bring down the top few rows of the apps so that you can access them in one hand use.Here are the things that I miss on Android:1. Full integration of almost any apps and control of default apps. I can set default apps on Android whereas Apple does not allow that. I can open up photos and upload them to Dropbox or any other app that I choose to, whereas Apple doesn't allow uploading to Dropbox via the Photos app (you have to open up Dropbox, then select upload and then go to Photos from there).2. Better email. In the mail app for Android, you can attach almost any file on the phone. You can't do that on Apple. You can't even attach a single file. You have to share a file as an email. So, forget about replying an email with an attachment. This is pretty annoying.3. Productivity is better on Android. If you are a big dropbox user, you probably know and love Dropsync on Android (seriously, best 5 bucks spent on any app). You can have an app that syncs and download any material from Dropbox onto your Android and then sync it back up when changes are detected. It's so seamless. Apple does NOT allow that (mainly because they don't allow background apps from accessing the hard drive, or something along those lines). So you have to download the file you are interested in manually from the Dropbox app. It just slows you down a lot, especially if you get to a part of a building where there is weak signal for wifi or cellular data.4. Notifications are way better. Why can't Apple make one button that clears all of your notifications? You have to individually close each app's own notification. I pretty much leave my notification screen untouched.5. Some other things that many already know: Google Now is way better/useful than Siri. Material design looks awesome! Way better widgets and the fact that you can have widgets!! Oh, and you can swipe right on the home screen on Android and that brings another screen from the left side... can't do that on iOS, the home page is set to be the left most one. More customization and etc.Conclusion:Overall, I think the iPhone is a fine device to use and you probably won't regret investing in one. The customer service from Apple is top notch, even if their parts cost an arm and leg. I think that, and I hate to say this because it's going to sound like every blog writer out there, the choice really does come down to personal preference and what you use the phone for. So, I've broken down my recommendation based on user case scenarios:If you are user type...Workaholic, Students: Android will be the best option unless your company/job dictates that you use an iPhone. The integration with all the apps and the feature with dropbox is just so important to anyone who works on their phones and other mobile devices. I would either get a pure Google device (N5 or N6, I like smaller phones... so N5 is up there) or a Google Edition device, or the Moto X. Samsung and HTC are also good choices but updates may be slow. One Plus One is actually pretty cool. They are not the best when it comes to customer service since they're a small company filling huge demand, but from my experience, the device is solid and definitely a work horse.Medical and Science community: iPhone. Unfortunately, most of the med and science people rely on Apple products, and a lot of new apps still come to iOS first or are better updated and designed on iOS.Recreational, use a phone as a communication device and for fun: iPhone. The camera and social apps are fun to use on the iPhone.For older folks: This is a split. If you've used Apple products before, then iOS will be easy to learn. Android phones have gotten a LOT easier to use thanks to a big push from Google dealing with not only the UI from a software perspective but also from a design perspective. It is more intuitive than it used to be.Photographer, blogger, foodie: iPhone 6 still has the best selection of apps and arguably the best camera. Samsung's camera is great, but the company is known to really bog down their stellar devices with bloatware that ruins or significantly slows down your phone after 1 year of use. I love the HTC ONE in design, but their gamble on the cameras have not paid off for their customers or themselves.So was this the right switch for me? As I'm learning more about the iPhone and iOS, I've realized that when the two year is over or whenever this phone dies on me, I'll most likely switch back to Android. While I think I've been thoroughly spoiled by the fingerprint sensor, the productivity that I enjoyed on Android just doesn't replicate itself here on the iPhone. Maybe it's not meant to be a super productive machine, but I guess my main point is that I'd like to have that option available when I need it.Another side note: Most of the shortfalls of either Android and iOS can be bypassed via means of rooting, custom ROMs, and jailbreaking (in the case of iOS). And I do understand that a lot of people enjoy doing this and can get their phones to work fantastically well. I used to do a lot of customization and go through ROMs once every three days on my Android devices, but I've come to realize that I'd rather spend that time using the device than customizing it. So, nowadays, I just want my devices to work right out of the box. The little details like a great camera, fingerprint sensor, and the ability to have my dropbox synced on the go and a good notification system should all be there when I turn on my phone.Summary and TL; DR:So there you have it. An Android user's thoughts on using the iPhone 6. Do I have regrets switching over? After using my friend's One Plus One and seeing Material Design on my old N4, I definitely regret it. But for now, the iPhone 6 suits my needs, even if there are occasional frustration points. If you are an Android user, please consider all these points and google similar stories before switching.Also, I'm one of those workaholics and forever in search of super productivity, hence my review that I'd like to go back to Android. However, I know plenty of people who swear by their iPhones for productivity. If you are always connected and depend on a suite of iOS specific apps (including apps that are better designed or work better on iOS), then chances are you love the iPhone. There are plenty of things to like and love about either OS. It really does come down to personal preference.***UPDATE 2/9/15: I got to try the new Outlook 2015 app by Microsoft, and it has alleviated a lot of the email/attachment issues that I have mentioned above. It allows you to sign into your Exchange, Outlook accounts as well as your Gmail, Yahoo, and iCloud emails. You can also integrate your OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Dropbox and Box accounts, and that's where the magic begins. Once integrated, you can attach any file located in those drives, which is great! You can also attach files that are attached in emails that are already in your inbox! And, you can now reply an email with the option of attaching a file. Finally, you can decide if you want to open up links from emails in Safari or another browser installed on your phone (so, you are no longer bound by default Apple apps). This is a huge step forward, and it's from Microsoft (a pleasant surprise). ***This app has really improved my productivity needs, since when considering the iPhone we have to take into account the hardware and the software/app ecosystem, i think this makes sense to bump up the rating to 4/5. There are still kinks when switching over if you are used to productive flexibility on Android phones, but right now the 3rd party apps are getting better and better at work-arounds.

Disappointed in iPhone,J w.,1,I just received my iPhone 6.  Was using iPhone 4s. I am disappointed in iPhone 6. It has poor battery life. I have gold my husband has space gray. They both loose battery life after 6-8 hours of r normal usage.  My iPhone 4s had better battery life.  I find it slower than expected. I thought Apple would have improved their technology more since iPhone 4s. Would not recommend upgrade until they improved. Regret getting this phone. It also get warmer to touch even with otter box defender case on. Updated April 26 2015. Still with closing out apps. Turning Bluetooth off.  Still loose battery power too quick. I have to charge throughout day. Came in package new. Disappointed in Apple iPhone 6 charge.

I actually like it a lot,Gregory E. Johnson,3,I actually like it a lot.  Coming from the iPhone 4, I like that the 6 is "exactly" like it only taller, lighter, slimmer and much faster. I can't give it more stars (My actual rating would be 3 1/2) because I don't understand why they put the headphone jack on the bottom???? Which, would be ok IF the iTunes app orientated upside down!!!! It doesn't orientate upside down, unless I totally missed something and I tried.  They also moved the power button to the right side opposite the volume up button, so that when I power off, until I get used to it, I'm also pressing the volume up.  In other words, had they kept the power button and the headphone jack as it was on the 4, I would have given it a 5.Other features I really like is the keyboard that has the text helper above it.  The microphone function is sweet too, and I'm using it right now as I am talking this text.  It is accurate.  The camera is very sharp.  I do like the size of the 6 as it fits in my hand nicely. Considered the 6+ but don't want the bulk of a 6+ with a case.Did I say that this baby is FAST!

I LIST THE IMPROVED FEATURES OVER THE 5.,Harkanwar Anand,4,I don't agree with critics who say Apple hasn't made significant improvements from the iPhone 5. Everyone who is reading this review has probably owned an iPhone 5 and some own even older models. There are a few improvements since say the iPhone 5 so I wanted to help the audience that has the iPhone 5 (not saying I exclude others)Here are the major improvements since the iPhone 5,a) CAMERA - My word, there is more detail, almost takes a photo in the worst ever lit room, very sharp, excellent photos, the macro could be a little better but you can download several applications to counter the macro recognition system. Older iPhone 5 now looks grainy.b) CALL QUALITY - Much louder on speaker, better earphone speaker than before. The iPhone 5 was very good but when I hold it right next to the iPhone 6, the difference is substantial.c) SPEAKER - Much louder, clearer, still wouldn't replace my JBL bluetooth but still good enough. Much clearer whether on phone call or while playing music. You almost never ever keep it on 100% volume cause its rudely loud otherwise. I have compared this with my wife's HTC one m8 and it is almost as loud as the boom speaker but we all know HTC has the best speaker.d) BUILD QUALITY - For the first month, I kind of regretted getting the 6 because it is so much bigger and the one handed operation was useless. I almost never use reachability. The 6 is much more slippery than the iPhone 5 and using without a case is not even an option. So I would say despite the changes, being lighter, i miss the 5's ease of use and builde) TOUCH ID - DOn't think it makes a difference? You are wrong. It is convenient if not flawless in execution.f) Display - The brightness and pixel density has improved which ideally means you will find watching videos much better. Owing to a better graphics procesor the iPhone 6 is better for reading, viewing videos.g) iOS 8 is definitely optimised for iPhone 6. I'm sorry but the Iphone 5 was running the iOS 8 really slow. I really hated it. I was almost strong armed into purchasing the iPhone 6 but overall I can't say I am not satisfied.Thank God for the 128GB. I no longer have to worry about keeping Pearl Jam's discography on my iPhone.h) OTHERS - It can charge faster if you use the iPad Air adapter, the battery life is much much better and lasts me about 18 hours which is satisfactory, I read this more often for reading because iBooks is so much fun on this, Apple Pay doesnt work where I live (we avoid using card and love CASH despite it being slimy)

Still in beta? Inferior in every respect I can find but size.,fitz,2,I've had the 6 and the 6 plus and the 6 plus seems like it should still be in beta. The screen has been programmed to be less bright to save your battery life. The touch screen isn't as good, kind of like a Samsung, and the phone is slow, kind of methodical. It doesn't seem to have enough power to smoothly scroll. What happened here Apple?
Very satisfied,Arthur S.,5,Great telephone, very good seller.This is not my first iPhone, but it's the best one until now. Very fast with apps and good camera, even with low lights.The seller was fast and the package arrived even before expected. No surprises, iPhone model A1549, unlocked, working with all chips even overseas.

Like an android phone,Don Reyes,5,It looks, feels, and operates almost like an android phone, which is great, because it gets the Apple support and connectivity with the more intuitive android display and interface. The display is not the best in the market anymore, though. The G3 has definitely edged Apple out of this.

The iPhone 6 plus is a great phone,windell,5,I absolutely love this phone it works like it is suppose to, I haven't ran into any problems and this is my second week with it.

Bugs, Glitches, Issues,I. Radas,1,I have had so many problems with this phone that I felt obligated to write a review. I don't know what exactly happened here with apple but this product just has problems. Before anyone starts accusing me of being an Android fan  I want to say that I actually really like iphone over android, I have had both in the past and I prefer iOS when it works properly.So here is my user experience with this phone, I received this phone a couple months ago, and when I initially got it it worked great, everything was smooth, calls were coming through fine, I liked the design of the phone, I thought it was perfect. About 2 weeks after I received the phone, there was a new iOS update that came out, so I went ahead and downloaded the new update. That is the point that all my problems started. After the update there were two main problems, one was that text messages would never come through for many of my contacts, I just never received them, they said they sent them and I actually looked at the other persons phone and I never got what was sent to me. The other problem that I had was continuously getting dropped and failed calls, I would make 3-4 calls to a person before I finally got it to ring, and even than it would sometimes connect with a lot of static.I worked extensively with my phone carrier, I called 7-8 times and performed all the same troubleshooting with every technician I spoke with, each call was around 2 hours, some were more, so I probably spent close to 20 hours troubleshooting these issues, I was able to get the phone to operate better by disabling iMessage which helped my texts and than by disabling voice over LTE and just having it be for data. This and I had to reset network settings on my phone, reset the settings and content a couple times, I also had several things that my phone carrier did for me, including registering me to their network again. After all of this was said and done, I greatly reduced the amount of dropped, and failed phone calls and I also received all text messages coming to my phone from that point on. My phone carrier told me I should go to the store and get a new phone, but I didn't because most of the problems were gone and it seemed to be working the way it shouldOk, so issue resolved right? Well, yes with that device, what happened was I had to get a new iPhone, so my iPhone was sitting in a case, and it really wasn't even in my pocket or anything, one day the colors on the bottom right of my screen got dimmer for some reason. So I brought it up to my phone carrier and they looked at it, and they checked for water damage and this and that and said that the phone looks physically fine, and that I would need to go to an apple store and get it replaced. I went to the Apple store and worked with technicians there, they also confirmed what my phone provider said, and were going to replace the screen only, but after looking at my phone they said the button on the side was a little stiff so they said it would be best to replace the phone entirely, well because I was already there and had all those issues in the past I thought my phone just might not have been made correctly and that I have a bad phone so I agreed and got the phone replaced with a brand new one.I don't know what exactly happened or what they did, the phone was trying to get all of the apps downloaded again that I had on my last phone, it was downloading and installing them for literally 2 days which I thought was really weird. The new phone seemed much better in regards to calls that I was having problems with, but the phone would not open a lot of apps, it would start opening and freeze, than sometimes the screen would turn black and pressing the power button or the home screen would not illuminate your phone. Also holding the power button down when it did this did not do anything to the phone. I figured out a way around it by pressing the power and the home at the same time I think it restarts it and it goes through the loading process. However, sometimes the wifi would also disconnect, than I would go in and try to reconnect, but I wouldn't be able to turn the wifi on through the settings.So I have had this iPhone 6 since late November, it is now the End of Febuary, Febuary 28th to be precise. That is a good 3 months to try out the phone, and it works and stuff, and I am able to use it, but there are all kinds of glitches that I mentioned above now, related to the screen going out and wifi not connecting and apps not loading or freezing the phone. The problems are not consistant either, so when the phone works it's great, but I've had two of them now, and in both cases I've had different intermittent problems and bugs come up in the last 3 months. Since I waited for a while to make a review I feel that I can really assess the phone.Most of the people on here give this phone a 5 star rating, blindly rating it. This is not a 5 star phone. I had a iPhone 3GS in the past that I had no problems with at all, than I got an HTC one which I had no real problems with it, but as the device got old the hardware started going so it needed to be replaced and I got this phone now. I think iOS is a much better user interface than Android, but since iOS 8 has come out it is far more buggy than android. The androids may not be as user friendly and might be slightly more complicated to use, and may not get some of the apps or there may be delays or whatever, but the androids worked, the phones stayed on and you could make phone calls and get texts. So my opinion is that Apple really rushed this phone, they did not put in the time or quality that they are known forRight now my phone seems to be working ok I guess, but the reason I am giving it a one star is because:1. Quality: The amount of bugs and glitches in this device is not acceptable, the iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus are the most expensive phones on the market right now, customers are paying this amount because they are expecting a higher quality product and are willing to pay for it. When the phone has so many problems with it that it's useless at times, and having problems even after you get a new device that says to me that the devices are not made well.2. Price: This is one of the most expensive phones on the market and Apple is overcharging for this phone, I felt that I had to get a 64GB phone because it's 2015, 16 GB would fill up immediately when you consider how large the apps are nowadays or how big the pictures are as well.3. Hardware: As mentioned above, the entry point on this phone is 16GB, I don't think that is acceptable for a premium phone at this point in time. Further, there are real problems when it comes to multitasking because of the lack of memory, this phone comes with only 1GB of RAM, this was fine in the last generation but considering that they're supposed to be competing against Samsung when you compare other premium phones from competitors it's really unacceptable. The S5 by Samsung I would consider it to be the regular iPhone 6's main competitor, it has 2GB of RAM but has been on the market for much longer than the iPhone 6. The Samsung Note 4 is the iPhone 6 plus's main competitor, it came out roughly around the same time the iPhone 6 plus came out, but it has 3 GB of RAM vs 1 GB of RAM, anyone that multitasks or accesses heavily intensive applications is going to notice choppiness especially with future releases of their operating system like iOS 9 and 10 whenever they come out. Considering that an extra gig of RAM would have cost the company at most an extra dollar per model and you are paying hundreds of dollars to begin with this is not ok. Also when you go to the store and you want a 64 GB storage card it doesn't cost hundreds of dollars, so the difference in price between the 16 and 64 GB version should not be $1004. Customer Service - As I mentioned I have been having a lot of problems with my phone, and I tried getting a new phone through my cellphone provider. If you have similar problems with any other phone by any other brand they will replace your cellphone while it's under warranty right there at the providers store, this is not the case with Apple products though, when an Apple product breaks the company forces the consumer to go to their nearest Apple store and get it addressed there. This is a big inconvenience, because over the life of your phone you may need to get things fixed multiple times, some people live really far away from Apple stores and can't be without their phones so shipping isn't really an option. I don't think a company can act this way to their customers and this in my opinion even though I know it's minor compared to the other things I've mentioned is kinda a big deal for me, I had to drive around town, wait in line at their store, wait at a genius desk or whatever for close to an hour to speak to someone, and than had to go back and do it all over again, I resent the Apple store, because there are not that many and everyone that has an iPhone that needs something fixed is there from every carrier, so it's not like you're in and out of there.There are a couple of good features on this phone that I will mention, one is the design, it is really nice and sleek, and an elegant look to it, but appearance doesn't mean hardly anything to me after the first 5 minutes especially when the phone doesn't function properly. The second really cool feature is the camera, I read some people that bash this phone and they start talking about the camera and say it's no good, these people do not understand how optics work, the lense is spectacular quality for a phone, you have a f2.2 aperature (the lower the number the more light comes in) this is really unheard of in mobile devices, the people giving bad reviews on the camera compare megapixels, what they don't understand is megapixels hardly mean anything, once you reach 5 megapixels your eyes really can't see more pixels in a photo, so it has plenty, but the image quality and the camera on this phone are really top notch.With all the being said, if my phone(s) that I got worked and I had no problems with it, I would have rated this phone a 4, because I do value quality, but would deduct a little for price, and the RAM issue because I don't think a premium phone should only have 1GB of ram and find that insulting to the customer, but my phone did have problems and continues to have problems, with the price tag being as high as it is and what people are expecting this phone is a complete let down and disappointment, it's very frustrating to deal with these issues and bugs, and the company needs to release products not on some kind of yearly schedule so it can announce it at a keynote presentation but rather when the product is ready for the market. I want a quality item not something that breaks and has issues with it, otherwise I would have bought a free phone which I would expect to have some problems and be fine with it. The fact that this item has so many problems and is really promoted by every carrier as the best product that they carry is absurd.

I am overall very pleased with my iPhone 6,Kaity,5,I am overall very pleased with my iPhone 6. It has not caused me any problems, nor have any other Apple products that I have owned. The iPhone 6 is incredible compared to my iPhone 4s.The iPhone 6 is much larger than the original iPhones; it makes reading and typing much easier for those with poor eyesight and for anyone in general. IPhone allows passwords to be in place when your phone is locked. It gives a sense of security and preserves the safety of information stored on the device. It is a family friendly phone, the apps and ways of iOS are extremely simple to get acquainted to for any person of age. There is also a strong sense of order in the iPhone 6. The phone has a strong industrial look; it is clean cut, crisp, and straight to the point.

iPhone for the masses,joey,5,The iPhone 6 takes the best of what works for apple and brings it to a form factor that the masses want.  Once you get used to the larger size, it's a great device.  However, previous iPhone users beware: the size does take time to get used to.  It's a larger device that makes one handed use more difficult.  Other than that, it's what you would expect from an iPhone: reliable, great camera, great screen, and any app you could possibly imagine.
Five Stars,Anh Nguyen,5,Really nice phone. Works like every other iPhone and it has an incredible camera!
a few changes could be made but all in all great,Zachary Lehman,4,I wish there was a function for more then one timer. I cook/bake as much a possible and am needing to time multiple things at once. Also there should be a lock option for photos. I get that apple is all about simplicity but some things aren't fully functional about this phone. I love my apple products as much as anybody else. I wouldn't purchase any other phone, that's why I give it a 4. As long as they keep it the best phone around, I will keep purchasing.

Excellent seller. All was he said also with questions ...,Diego,4,Excellent seller. All was he said also with questions I made by email. Recommended. And the product was as I expectedMusic lovers... what you need to know.,Wayne,3,Feature to feature with Android, the most critical feature that's amiss with iPhone is the quality of their music services.  This may sound astounding to you as it was to me but iTunes is one of the worst music software or general software application that exists.  Portable music devices is what really put Apple over the top the last decade.  So you'd imagine iTunes would just work like it's supposed to.  You'd be surprised how bad it is if you're switching over from Android music services such as Amazon Music.  I've had most of my music collection on Amazon Music.  Switching to Apple I thought it would be as easy as subscribing to iTunes Match and pushing my collection to iTunes cloud.  Not so simple.  Using iTunes on my pc it failed to recognize more than half of my mp3s.  Apparently, this is a known issue with users complaining on the Apple support forums about how poor the matching software is.  It's slow when it works but most of the time it doesn't.  In comparison, Amazon Music matching is a breeze.  the quality of the code is superior.  Now when you subscribe to iTunes Match you're supposed to get iTunes Radio without commercials.  All I ever got was commercials on the iPhone and iTunes on PC.  So this is a backend problem not necessarily tied to a device.  The iTunes interface on iPhone is just horrible.  The Music app to play your music is also horrible.  The user experience is lacking with little update or innovation over the last several years.The biggest problem with iTunes is that it's not an AppStore application but tightly integrated with iOS release.  I'd imagine iTunes upgrades and enhancements would be markedly improved if it was separated out as it's own App Store app.  There's little likelihood this will happen anytime soon, however, as there appears to be a monetary reason behind this intentional tightly coupled integration.  When you use apps like Shazaam or SoundHound and intend to purchase a track you can only do so thru iTunes.  That's also a drag.  You can't purchase from, say, Amazon Music (android users know you can purchase tracks from any music provider on the platform).  For apple to continue their music monopoly on IOS they have to package the music services as part of their platform, that there are technical reasons why they can't open up their platform to 3rd party music purchasing services.  Therein lies their own demise of their music platform. There's little incentive to innovate.  What's odd even still is how anti-trust lawsuits haven't surfaced already.  If Microsoft can get slammed for shipping their own browser with their OS, then how is it that Apple can go unscathed for purposely limiting customers freedom to choose their music provider?IOS is pretty good in general.  It's definitely better than Android or a linux hacked OS.  It's better quality software in general and I like the fact the hardware doesn't get hung up in some deadlock.  I can almost always escape some kind of software locking through the home button which seems to force a hardware interrupt.  It's a better system software for sure.  iTunes and it's supporting software, however, is pure crap.  Thumbs up if you think this review will help anyone else make their switch over from android.

Best phone I have ever owned,Rodney K.,5,I went from a iPhone 4s to a galaxy s5 then to the iPhone 6 and it is by far the best phone I have ever had.  It is very fast and responsive.  The camera is excellent and does not have the delay that the s5 had.  The finger print scanner is excellent and a feature that is surprisingly useful.  You can unlock your iPhone with it or purchase stuff online with just your finger print.  I know the s5 also has one but it is years behind and can only be set up with one finger where the iPhone you can set multiple fingers which makes it nice if you switch hands while using the phone.  Also you have to swipe to unlock the S5 which can take multiple times to do where is the iPhone really takes more than a half second touch and unlock.  The battery life for me was about the same as on the s5 although I did like the power saving mode on the s5 which iPhone does not have.  The charging time on the iPhone seems to be about half the time it took to charge the galaxy S5 though so it's nice to know if you can plug it in for a few minutes you can charge about a percent per minute where the s5 was about 1% every two minutes. Another thing I prefer on the iOS system is Siri which is also years ahead of Google talk.  Much more useful, understands me better, many more functions and just much more refined.  If you're on the fence for a new phone the iPhone six will not disappoint you.

Amazing Camera, Great Battery Life and Nice Screen, but really big,AK529,4,This is actually my first iphone. I used to have a Samsung S4 before this. I tried the iPhone 6, but found it too small. Personally I wished that apple made an iphone thats around 5" or 5.2". Im not much of a phablet person, but I decided to try the 6 plus since I wanted an iphone which was larger than the 6. It took me a good 2 weeks to get used to using it. Its a great smartphone with amazing battery life. I can easily get 2-3 days usage out of it. I really like the camera. Its fast, the low light performance is great and its easy to use. The screen gets very bright for outdoor use in the sun. The speaker is very loud, good for music and calls. I do wish there was a stereo speaker. I also wish the 6 plus was smaller in dimensions. Apple has wasted  alot of space especially on the top bezel. The bottom bezel is understanable because of the touch id. Im sure apple will find a way to trim down the 6 plus when the iphone 7 comes out. Performance wise the 6 plus seems great you wouldnt be able to tell it only has 1gb of ram. Lte, 3g and wifi is fast. Call quality is great. Overall I like it but wish the dimensions were smaller and it had stereo speakers.

An Android User's Review of the iPhone 6: Read this if you are thinking of switching from Android!!!,Jay,4,So I made the switch from using Android to the iPhone back in October, and I've been using the iPhone 6 for the past few months now and can give a detailed review on what it's like to switch over.  Before this switch, I've used the Samsung Galaxy S2 (first smartphone ever!) and also the Nexus 4.  Since I'm a tech enthusiast, I'm well versed and have played around with many other Android devices, including all the big names, Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 and M7, One Plus One, and so on.  Here are my thoughts:Things that the iPhone does really well (both hardware and software-wise):1. Camera.  The behind the scene software for digitally capturing an image is definitely the strongest sell for the iPhone.  Other than the S5 and Note 4, no smartphone really comes close to having the same kind of image quality (no matter the megapixels) compared to the iPhone.  This was one of the reasons for me to switch over since I've started to dabble with photography and wanted a really good camera in my smartphone.  (Side note, if you read a lot of tech blogs, there is a notion that in the near future our smartphones won't accurately describe our devices anymore since making a phone call is probably one of the least commonly used features on a smartphone when you look at any average user.  Cameras, social media, emails all take a higher usage rate than making a call... really interesting, but anyway, back to the review).2.  Reliability.  There have been maybe 2 or 3 times when my phone crashed and would have to be restarted, mostly due to playing some game that was not written very well for the iOS devices.  On Android devices, I've experienced a lot more crashes, and that may be due to the fact that so many apps haven't figured out the best way to optimize the app for each individual phone due to the fragmentation problems or something else.  Either way, I feel like the iOS environment and hardware is more reliable in my everyday use.3. Fingerprint sensor.  Once you've used it, you won't go back.  The S5 is not that close yet in terms of usability with their sensor.  The one in the iPhone 6 works really well.  I definitely have found myself using my phone more because of how easy it is to unlock and install apps.4. Control of apps.  This is an interesting point.  In general, you get way more control over how to use and how to integrate your apps on Android than iOS.  But in iOS, it's really interesting that you can control the kind of notification that gets sent to your phone, background refresh, location requirement, and access to certain things like photos and camera.  In Android, you can do all of this as well, but sometimes for a lot of apps you have to have root access.5.  Double tap to bring down the row of apps.  I can't believe no one has thought of this before.  A lot of Android phones have gigantic screens, but no one has really figured out how to best get the users to interact with that.  You can tap the home button twice on the iPhone to bring down the top few rows of the apps so that you can access them in one hand use.Here are the things that I miss on Android:1. Full integration of almost any apps and control of default apps.  I can set default apps on Android whereas Apple does not allow that.  I can open up photos and upload them to Dropbox or any other app that I choose to, whereas Apple doesn't allow uploading to Dropbox via the Photos app (you have to open up Dropbox, then select upload and then go to Photos from there).2. Better email.  In the mail app for Android, you can attach almost any file on the phone.  You can't do that on Apple.  You can't even attach a single file.  You have to share a file as an email.  So, forget about replying an email with an attachment.  This is pretty annoying.3. Productivity is better on Android.  If you are a big dropbox user, you probably know and love Dropsync on Android (seriously, best 5 bucks spent on any app).  You can have an app that syncs and download any material from Dropbox onto your Android and then sync it back up when changes are detected.  It's so seamless.  Apple does NOT allow that (mainly because they don't allow background apps from accessing the hard drive, or something along those lines).  So you have to download the file you are interested in manually from the Dropbox app.  It just slows you down a lot, especially if you get to a part of a building where there is weak signal for wifi or cellular data.4. Notifications are way better.  Why can't Apple make one button that clears all of your notifications?  You have to individually close each app's own notification.  I pretty much leave my notification screen untouched.5.  Some other things that many already know: Google Now is way better/useful than Siri.  Material design looks awesome! Way better widgets and the fact that you can have widgets!! Oh, and you can swipe right on the home screen on Android and that brings another screen from the left side... can't do that on iOS, the home page is set to be the left most one.  More customization and etc.Conclusion:Overall, I think the iPhone is a fine device to use and you probably won't regret investing in one.  The customer service from Apple is top notch, even if their parts cost an arm and leg.  I think that, and I hate to say this because it's going to sound like every blog writer out there, the choice really does come down to personal preference and what you use the phone for.  So, I've broken down my recommendation based on user case scenarios:If you are user type...Workaholic, Students: Android will be the best option unless your company/job dictates that you use an iPhone.  The integration with all the apps and the feature with dropbox is just so important to anyone who works on their phones and other mobile devices.  I would either get a pure Google device (N5 or N6, I like smaller phones... so N5 is up there) or a Google Edition device, or the Moto X.  Samsung and HTC are also good choices but updates may be slow.  One Plus One is actually pretty cool.  They are not the best when it comes to customer service since they're a small company filling huge demand, but from my experience, the device is solid and definitely a work horse.Medical and Science community: iPhone.  Unfortunately, most of the med and science people rely on Apple products, and a lot of new apps still come to iOS first or are better updated and designed on iOS.Recreational, use a phone as a communication device and for fun:  iPhone.  The camera and social apps are fun to use on the iPhone.For older folks: This is a split.  If you've used Apple products before, then iOS will be easy to learn.  Android phones have gotten a LOT easier to use thanks to a big push from Google dealing with not only the UI from a software perspective but also from a design perspective.  It is more intuitive than it used to be.Photographer, blogger, foodie: iPhone 6 still has the best selection of apps and arguably the best camera.  Samsung's camera is great, but the company is known to really bog down their stellar devices with bloatware that ruins or significantly slows down your phone after 1 year of use.  I love the HTC ONE in design, but their gamble on the cameras have not paid off for their customers or themselves.So was this the right switch for me?  As I'm learning more about the iPhone and iOS, I've realized that when the two year is over or whenever this phone dies on me, I'll most likely switch back to Android.  While I think I've been thoroughly spoiled by the fingerprint sensor, the productivity that I enjoyed on Android just doesn't replicate itself here on the iPhone.  Maybe it's not meant to be a super productive machine, but I guess my main point is that I'd like to have that option available when I need it.Another side note:  Most of the shortfalls of either Android and iOS can be bypassed via means of rooting, custom ROMs, and jailbreaking (in the case of iOS).  And I do understand that a lot of people enjoy doing this and can get their phones to work fantastically well.  I used to do a lot of customization and go through ROMs once every three days on my Android devices, but I've come to realize that I'd rather spend that time using the device than customizing it.  So, nowadays, I just want my devices to work right out of the box.  The little details like a great camera, fingerprint sensor, and the ability to have my dropbox synced on the go and a good notification system should all be there when I turn on my phone.Summary and TL; DR:So there you have it.  An Android user's thoughts on using the iPhone 6.  Do I have regrets switching over?  After using my friend's One Plus One and seeing Material Design on my old N4, I definitely regret it.  But for now, the iPhone 6 suits my needs, even if there are occasional frustration points.  If you are an Android user, please consider all these points and google similar stories before switching.Also, I'm one of those workaholics and forever in search of super productivity, hence my review that I'd like to go back to Android.  However, I know plenty of people who swear by their iPhones for productivity.  If you are always connected and depend on a suite of iOS specific apps (including apps that are better designed or work better on iOS), then chances are you love the iPhone.  There are plenty of things to like and love about either OS.  It really does come down to personal preference.***UPDATE 2/9/15: I got to try the new Outlook 2015 app by Microsoft, and it has alleviated a lot of the email/attachment issues that I have mentioned above.  It allows you to sign into your Exchange, Outlook accounts as well as your Gmail, Yahoo, and iCloud emails.  You can also integrate your OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Dropbox and Box accounts, and that's where the magic begins.  Once integrated, you can attach any file located in those drives, which is great!  You can also attach files that are attached in emails that are already in your inbox!  And, you can now reply an email with the option of attaching a file.  Finally, you can decide if you want to open up links from emails in Safari or another browser installed on your phone (so, you are no longer bound by default Apple apps).  This is a huge step forward, and it's from Microsoft (a pleasant surprise).  ***This app has really improved my productivity needs, since when considering the iPhone we have to take into account the hardware and the software/app ecosystem, i think this makes sense to bump up the rating to 4/5.  There are still kinks when switching over if you are used to productive flexibility on Android phones, but right now the 3rd party apps are getting better and better at work-arounds.

Five Stars,lais maxixe santos,5,excelentWould buy again from this seller,lindamariacelina "lma",5,Love it !

Stop complaining,diego,5,I don't really understand what this complaints in the reviews are about. If you don't like iPhones because "androids have way more technology" then don't buy and iphone and stick to android. Now if you drop a phone and it cracks it's not the phones fault you can't be careful enough to handle an expensive device and it also not the phones fault you are way to cheap to protect the phone which is an investment in my eyes. I work for sprint and I hear this on a daily basis. If you don't like the phone then stay away from it and if you break it don't complain about it if you didn't buy a case.Excellent phone!,M. Howes "AnalogKid",5,3GS, 4S, and now a 6. Excellent phone!

The Sexiest Phone,Jay sidhu,5,its better to choose 64gb instead of 16gb cause for the next biggest iOS update , You Will run out of Storage  !
The best cell phone, ever?,B. Austin,1,The iPhone 6 is the pinnacle of mobile computing, a fast and beautifully engineered device that integrates smoothly with both Macs and iPads. I'm a Fanboy, yes, but I've tried Android phones. I've given the competition a fair shake. I went from an iPhone 4s to a Samsung Note 2 and then to a Moto X and I was so aggravated by the constant trade-offs that I finally just gave up and went back to Apple. Android devices stuttered when scrolling, didn't create hotspots when I needed them, and inconsistently connected to Bluetooth. Cameras were slow and awkward and you were lucky to get more than one or two OS updates (my Note 2 on T-Mobile never got 4.4). These are things I take for granted on an iPhone.So why the 1 star? Because Apple never ceases to disgust me with their power adapters. Great phone, horrible horrible cables. No other tablet or phone manufacturer uses a proprietary format and if one or two does, then they don't deliberately sabotage 3rd party adapters to force you into overpriced Apple ones. I needed a 30pin to Lightning adapter to control my iPhone from my car. $40 for the official Apple model. That's like buying HDMI cables at Best Buy. I'm pretty sure there's a chapter in Business 101 that says if you're getting compared to Best Buy, then you're doing something wrong.Last week I had to drive my wife's Buick. The 3rd party cables that worked in my car could not charge in hers. These same cables worked fine later when connected to my MacBook. So Apple is cool when you're using another manufacturer's cable connected to your Apple computer, but not the USB port in a car? That's just mean.The worst part is that Apple's got me bent over a barrel. I love their phones. Android phones may be bigger, faster, and have more features, but none provide the consistently I need from my phone. So I'm trapped with a drawer full of Lightning cables that may or may not work when I need them.

I love my iPhone 6 plus,john browning,5,I love my iPhone 6 plus, I had the 5s and whenever I use my old phone( I gave it to my mother) I feel like I need a magnifying glass to use it. At first it took me a while to adjust to the size of the 6 plus but now I love it and would recommend this phone to everyone! The battery life is great, I can be texting and using my social media sites, from 7 A.M. To 5 P.M. and it only be on 40%. On my iPhone 5s I would have to charge it at noon. The graphics are also alot better!So sooo in love!!,Pauly802,5,Ok so I have been getting a new iPhone now every year sense my first 3gs. I just love iPhones and everything about them. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because as great as they are the structure never seems to be as good as it should. I have shattered 3 screens now. The first two happened over a period of time and after many drops but with my iPhone 6 I shattered the screen the first week. I was bending down to grab something and it fell no more than two feet and that was it for the screen. The advancements to iOS 8 are amazing though. I've always preferred apple os. I will continue to buy iPhones every year as they come out!
Five Stars,ejwork tsekara,5,Very nice
iPhone is the way to go,Daniel Psomas,5,Well I had a iphone 5, but wanted to try something new, so I decided to get a Samsung Note 4. Worst mistake, the iPhone's themselves are the best phones out there and you get more with your money. The Samsung had glitches and often times I would touch the screen and it would not respond, like an iPhone does. So needles to say I went back to my over 2 year old iPhone 5, and works better then a new Samsung. I guess I will never be making the same mistake by switching to another device. iPhone is the way to go. I wish they had some competition, but apparently not.  Then I switched over to the iPhone 6, greatest decision has a larger screen that is clear with a faster processor. I am very impressed with what I got and it came as advertised and fast shipping!

AT&T wouldn't print this review!,nkay "nkay",3,Apple has blown it on this phone.I've had my iPhone 6 for over a month now and although I'm a huge fan of iPhone and I have had them all since they first came out, I am not impressed with this phone. It's just too big. The iPhone 5 was solid and beautiful. The shape and feel of it was perfect. The only problem was battery life. I wish they'd stuck closer to this style and size but made it thicker to last longer.This new ones feel weak and flimsy and if it didn't have the double tap to bring the top down, I would've returned this and got the 5S. This phone works pretty well but the battery life still sucks and it looks like a Samsung. They also totally screwed up moving the off button from the top to the side so when its in your pocket you cant hit it. I think that Apple may be through now that Jobs is gone...The only reason I gave 3 stars is because it still has features I love but the design of the this phone is just weak, poorly designed and lacks the beautiful solid designs of the past.

Think twice before buying I-Phone,Cetinkaya,1,I have been an Apple user for the past 5 years. I have used I-phone 4, Iphone4s,Iphone 5,Iphone 5s, Apple TV, IPAD 2, and IPAD mini. My first apple product I-Phone 4 is still working. Apple has changed since then especially after Steve Jobs. I think new products are unreliable. I am upset because I am getting ready to bury my I-Phone 5 because it turned off without a reason and now apple associate calls it a "dead unit." I have been using it for one and half years. I took care of it very nicely. On Monday it turned off randomly couple times, i restored it and it did not help either. Now it is not turning on. I took it to Apple store and they said that it is dead unit and out of warranty that i should have bought extended warranty. It is frustrating since i did not use at least for two years.If you are planing to buy I-Phone 5 or I-Phone 6, think twice. I am done with apple products, not buying I-Phones any more. If you are buying I-Phone 6, you are good at least for a year (limited warranty).

power and frame issues,tony chan,3,Wife bought one, which was defective (plate was loose), Verizon replaced it and works like any other iPhone bit with a larger screen. I purchased one and returned it after the home button would overheat and the battery drained completely in 3 hours with nearly no usage. So, 2 of 3 iPhone 6 we purchased were defective. I think they are trying to push out as many phones as possible and they're sacrificing inspection and quality control measures. Otherwise, for the average person who waste their money on these expensive phones and never full uses it to it's full potential, this is just like any other iPhone with a bigger screen. Not worth it to me. Cost to product ratio would result in low star rating for me
great device - has some physical design issues,MKOW,5,This is my 2nd iPhone (Verizon), coming from an iPhone 5.I'm an Apple enthusiast so this was an obvious choice for me.Overall, the phone is awesome but I not necessarily suggest anyone immediately upgrade from the 5/5s unless they are compelled to do so.It is fast opening and closing apps, websites, etc. but not a huge difference to make me suggest to hurry up and buy it.I only got an iPhone 6 because my daughter was in need of her first iPhone, so it made sense to give her my old iPhone 5.The screen response is perfect and the thumb print works 90% of the time and is really convenient to get into the phone.There are a few shortcomings, however:1. The protruding rear camera lens is just stupid - so you really can't set the naked phone on its back without worrying about it.2. The rolled edges on the glass are just stupid - this means that a screen protector cannot go edge to edge.  It also means that most any case will have a gap between it and the glass at the eye of the case.3. Too thin - yes, this phone is too thin - hence the protruding rear camera issue.  Thinness also contributes to making the phone very slippery and very easy to drop.  Maybe that is what Apple wants - drop the phone often so you have to replace it often?4. Confounding the thinness issue are the rounded edges.  Rounded edges make many cases very easy to slip off, or at least not fit as snug as they otherwise could.5. Not case friendly:  Thin + round edge + rolled glass edges = a very unfriendly phone to accepting cases and screen protectors.  Overall, I find the old iPhone 5/5s much easier to fit a case to it and install a screen protector.So, the iPhone 6 is a very cool device. For everyday use like email and Internet, I really do not notice any speed difference, but some web pages open slightly faster. Buy this phone for increased screen size.  I like the screen size, but would probably have bought a smaller (normal?) screen if they made that - the added size does make it a bit less "pocketable." The 6+ seems like it would be too large for most folks - where do you carry it?  I ended up with the Otterbox Defender case, BTW, and it seems to work out fine and is very protective and still fits in my back pocket, shirt pocket, or cargo-pant pocket (I drop my phone a lot, so it suits my needs).I use it for work, play, investing and checking stocks, pictures, video, texting, notes, to-do list, play guitar with iRig, music, emergency flashlight, reading news, reading Kindle books, watching YouTube and Amazon instant video, running apps, hands-free phone in car, and the list goes on and on.  What other purchase on the planet enables so many things to be done with it?  A smart phone is a no-brainer, really.  So, at this point I will always have an iPhone. And my wife and daughter have iPhones too. Just so convenient on so many levels and essential to stay in touch in a busy lifestyle.  Pictures do seem crisper with this phone.  You can't go wrong with this device. Period.But that does not mean it is perfect - the physical deficiencies I have noted, IMHO, are a step backwards for this device, performance aside. The protruding camera, really, by today's standards and by Apple's design theme of sleekness, is just stupid and very unexpected. But, at the end of the day, it is an iPhone and functionally it does exactly what I have come to expect it to do.

Good phone, but Apple could have done much better.,ART,4,I have been using iPhones for 4 years, and I have to say that this latest version is much faster than iPhone 5s. Though, it has some issues related to the new iOS (i.e Alarm won't go off, some app does not work on it) and design flaws. The curved corners seems to be nice, but if you look at them closely, you will see they were not able to make the corner as clear as other parts of the iphone, Kind of messy work there for a company like Apple. Other than than, I feel they kind of copied Samsung Galaxy S3 phone lock/turn on/off button. Other than this, iPhone 6 is still much better than the Galaxy phones or any android based smartphones I have tried.

Apple is going to sh....,J. A. Maynor "Be the change...",2,This phone will serve its purposes but it just might be the last Apple product I buy.After unboxing my phone and running through the normal procedure of getting my info into it, I noticed the screen made a popping noise. I could literally push the screen in about a millimeter.I scheduled an appointment with Apple and they took a look at it with their team of geniuses and concluded that it was within normal operation. I told them that having a loose screen is a bad design and the guy actually scoffs at me, and says, "for what? A mere millimeter of movement?"So, come to find out, this is a known issue and it will not be resolved any time soon. It's considered "normal". Go ahead and Google loose screen iphone 6. I'm not the first and won't be the last. I've always been an apple user but I seriously think that the company has peaked and is on its way to being mediocre at best.
The new iPhone 6 is the best iPhone out there,Juan,5,The new iPhone 6 is the best iPhone out there. My iPhone 6 was a Christmas present but I got it 3 weeks early thinking they would sell out for the holidays. My dad, mom, sister, and me all got the iPhone 6. When they first handed me my phone I felt like I wasn't holding a phone. I felt like I was holding something out of this world. And that's what Apple does every time they make a product. They make sure you will love it till the end. Whenever you get a new iPhone, no matter what generation, you will be holding something that is worth its pricing. Some might say, oh the iPhone is too expensive, but if they made the effort to get one, they would understand it's not too expensive. Its pricing is just fine. I upgraded from the iPhone 4s to the iPhone 6. That's a big upgrade. All I can say is I really recommend the new iPhone 6. You will love it just as much as I do.
again,Kindle Customer,5,Nice
Five Stars,JuhuiLee,5,good
Great phone but VERY easy to drop,Mr Bill,5,The iPhone 6 is a great smartphone in all respects, but compared to my iPhone 5 and the earlier iPhones, the iphone 6 is much more " slippery" and likely to be dropped.  The light weight, the smoothly rounded tapered edges, the thinness, and the slightly larger size all contribute to this. So in my opinion a case, even a thin minimalist case, is absolutely necessary to avoid expensive damage.

Great for Apple fans,Robert,3,I purchased this phone since my employer wants their employees using an Apple product for their apps.  I've used Android and Windows phones as well. The pros are good build quality, nice display, good sound and call quality, decent battery life. But, IMO, you can get all this with an Android device at a fraction of the cost. Die hard Apple fans will be happy regardless. Windows phones are by far the best bang for the buck, but apps are still limited.  Several big annoyances for me with the Apple phone. You're stuck having to install and use iTunes to manage the phone such as to add music or ringtones. Even with the majority of 3rd party programs, iTunes still needs to be installed for them to work. If there is any bug or problem with iTunes, then you can have problems. I could not get music on my PC to sync with the phone whether using iTunes or a 3rd party program. The transfer would just fail without any warning. After more than 20 minutes on phone with Apple tech, who couldn't figure the problem out, I was disconnected and never got a call back. Ended up trouble shooting the problem myself and discovered the trouble was from the iTunes installation being on a "locked drive". Google "repair security permissions for itunes for windows" for the solution.  If you don't have unlimited data, and want to turn cellular data off, you may find your bluetooth voice commands won't work.  You'll need to turn Siri off for them to work, otherwise, you'll have to listen to Siri telling you to connect to the internet.  If you're a fan of Apple and don't care about price, or there is a business need to use Apple, buy this phone. If you want value for your money, have the freedom of choice, and to optimize for your personal use, then you have many more and better options elsewhere. A final word, imo, if you want the best price on an unlocked gsm iphone 6, buy it direct from Apple.  I can verify that the no contract T-mobile iphone 6 they sell will work just fine with an AT&T sim card.

Five Stars,DIEGO S.,5,Everything OK!
Great Phone, but needs work!,Chris M,4,I'll lead in to this letting everyone know I have a love/hate relationship with Apple being an Apple user since the early 90's. I have seen the things that have changed and the things that have stayed the same as Apple has moved from being a sinking dinghy to a thriving cruise line.I switched from Android to this iPhone, but I have had quite a bit of experience with iPhones as my family has them, I have a model for work, etc. In general Android is far more flexible in allowing the user to create their own experience. It's like a car, you pick the model with the factory and dealer installed options you want and then you can make your own changes. Apple limits the user modifications heavily (specifics below).I switched from Android because I was tired of all freezes, pauses and crashes and all the iPhone reviews state the opposite. My hope is that I can live without the customization abilities to get a more stable and responsive solution. So far my experience is the iPhone is hands down the better hardware, better hardware/software integrate and has far better performance and stability.For reference on performance and stability, I have 154 apps installed, am using 75.2GB of the storage, 60.4 for purchased videos, 3.7GB for Photos & Videos taken by the camera, 1.7GB Music, 2.7GB for Apple's productivity apps, 182MB mail (8 mail accounts, 3 are Exchange accounts), have custom mail signatures for all accounts, custom notifications for everything including different notifications for each mail account, use the Do Not Disturb feature option and have it enable automatically in the evening, use the Control Center and Notification Center often, have customized the Notification Center, Wallpaper on the home and lock screens, use WiFi, Bluetooth and VPN often, use iCloud and Passbook/Apple Pay, have many alarms, etc. Point is with all this the iPhone is responsive and stable and with a few exceptions the iPhone version of apps have been better than their Android counterparts.Batter life seems better, but comparing a Galaxy Note 2 (2 years old) with a current iPhone is not fair. As far as the other comparisons, I know people who have Galaxy S5's, Note 4's and other android phones and the performance and stability problems still exist which is backed by the reviews.I will say that the camera is not as amazing as indicated. I have had many issues with graininess and very slow focus. It's certainly hard to get a good picture quickly.I have been told that the iPhone is a more polished product and I would agree, but I would say it's a very polished version 1.5 to 2.5 product. However, some items are clearly further along because Apple has focused on those apps/features.The most glaring thing lacking customization in the iPhone, the version 1.0 item, is the clock. With everything that Apple does to make our lives easier, they are glued to a 1970s/1980s electronic alarm clock paradigm.1) You have no control over snooze time and therefore, there is no default setting that the user can change, no per alarm snooze time option and no on the fly snooze time options.2) An alarm can be set for the next occurrence of the time you set or every x day, but not this Friday just one time or for a specific date. You have to set your alarm the day before or if your future planning fits with the limited options, you can plan your alarms ahead. So I'll create an alarm, turn it off and then set a reminder to remind me to turn it on. That seems more complicated than it should be.3) Someone will say, just replace the clock, except only the Apple clock works with an option like Do Not Disturb on, so if DND is on you have to leave a 3rd party clock app up on the screen, not in the background, for the alarms to work. I use DND because during sleep time I only want calls, texts and alarms and I can click the silent switch to disable call and text sounds on the fly.The bottom line is that it is clear that Apple does not care about this app and there is not a good replacement option.Another glaring issue is iMessage and SMS. Why do I need to care if my contacts iPhone is connected in a way that allows special iMessage messages. If iMessage can't reach an SMS device via iMessage, then it should automatically send the message as SMS. It should not take 10 minutes or hours or days or longer if ever for people to get a text. I can turn those features off, but I lose functionality that does not require iMessage that Apple only provides for iMessage contacts. This is another immature thing. It's like a CD player made by a record label that only plays CDs produced by said label.This and the lack of being able to seamlessly use Google Voice are the only things that keep Android in my view. For reference, in Android you can set your default app to use for everything including phone, messaging, etc. So if I opened the main phone app, typed in a number or selected from the address book, when I clicked call it would call with my default which could be my Verizon number or my GV number or I could set it to ask me. So yes I can use GV on my iPhone, but not with that level of convenience.The list below is not exhaustive, but provides a good example of why I consider it version 1.5 to 2.5 software.1) Already covered alarm clock app, iMessage and SMS and app integration like I described with Google Voice.2) No status indicator when in silent mode (switch on side of phone). Some have said just look at the switch. Well there are a number of reasons why that is not the best option for everyone. It's hard to see in the dark. If you have a case it's even harder to see. By that logic, get rid of all status icons and you can go to the respective setting to see the status of that item. It's a simple status icon and there should be an option to show it.3) When selecting from the address book to add contacts to mail, imessage, etc, it would be awesome if you could select multiple. i.e. I may search for work contacts and want to select more than one rather than performing the same search over and over.4) Limited options when working with Bluetooth and WiFi connections. You can forget a device and with Bluetooth, there may be some options, but you can't simply disconnect from a device or network and with bluetooth you can't limit what the device is used for. i.e. I may have a bluetooth earpiece for making calls, but I may not want music to come through that device.With the disconnect sometimes it's convenient to disconnect without turning off the feature especially with bluetooth which should support multiple pairings. For WiFi, I had an issue where it would not see other networks. Turning it off and on did not fix the issue. I had to forget the network that it was automatically attaching to and then I could see other networks. Having to forget a device or network should not be the solution. That should only have to be used if you want to forget the item or there is a problem with that specific item.5) For Do Not Disturb you have one auto option so you can have auto on/off on different days and when turning it on on the fly you have no option to turn it off after a period of time.6) The Command Center is nice, but it leaves much to be desired. Being able to quickly turn items on and off is nice, but what if you want to choose a specific WiFi network or Bluetooth device.How about being able to click and hold to select from a list of devices/networks with an option to open the WiFi/Bluetooth main settings?At the very least, and this should be there even if the more specific options described above are provided, a button to open settings.How about allowing an option to allow the Command Center to be accessed via the Notification Center (pulled from the top)?7) Changing settings can be a pain. I do like that there is a single place you can go for some settings such as notifications, Cellular Data Use, privacy, etc and a single place to quickly get to all app settings, but that benefit should not remove the ability to get to all of these settings from within an app. It's the equivalent of adding steering wheel controls for the radio, a/c, etc and removing the corresponding console controls.8) The mail app is nice, but there are some issues.When adding a more complex (standard) signature with an image and hyperlinks, the settings app crashes and it looses my images, so a couple of emails have the image and then the image disappears.Not being able to set per folder "Mail Days to Sync" is a bummer. I have folders that I keep all important mail in that I need access to offline. I have other folders that have a lot of mail and I do not want all the messages in those folders to download when I do have to look at them on occasion. There needs to be more flexibility with this option.The options unread, To or CC, VIP, Flagged, attachments, etc per mailbox would be nice.This is my review and I hope it helps you!
Great unlocked iPhone 6,Hockey Mom,5,I wanted to write a review because the reviews that I read were very important to me when I was trying to decide what iPhone 6 to order. My iPhone 6 is working GREAT!  We live overseas and so I had to buy an unlocked phone to be able to use in the states and overseas.  This one worked awesome!  I did take it to my local AT&T office to switch the chip, but that is more because I am not technically savvy and wanted to make sure that nothing went array.  I would recommend this phone and this seller.
SUPERB SERVICE,NICOLAS STARZENSKI,5,EXCELLENT STUFF. SURPASS MY EXPECTATIONS. COMPLETELY SATISFIED. EXCELLENT DELIVERY SERVICE.
iPhone 6 A1549 unlocked, just OK...,Osiricat ">> By Osiricat",3,I got this one through TechnoMaster. Good seller this`s my 2nd iPhone Unlocked through this guys. This is iPhone 6 Model A1549, works with DIGITEL in Venezuela also LTE is properly working. I also try a Telefonica SIM in Mexico, and AT&T Sim in the US with no issues at all. Truly an unlocked one. Box come in original sealed package.Why I choose 3 stars? Well, I`ve been an iPhone user since 1st gen iPhone, iPhone3, iPhone4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPhone 5S and meanwhile this iPhone 6... I`ll always felt better with every new iPhone until this one. I believe iPhone 5S is equal or a little faster than this iPhone 6, also the user experience with phone proportions is better in iPhone 5S. Is really annoying need to use the "smart small screen" function (press home button in a tricky way) because the screen is so big that you need to use both hands for some functions. Yes the bigger screen is great when you have the time to browse the web, read your emails and so on, also to people with vision issues (the bigger letters are simple better), BUT for me, I use this iPhone mainly LIKE A PHONE, and it is just better the iPhone 5S size for FULL and faster functionality with only one hand.Also, I`m really MAD with iOs bugs, for example, if you use the "Vibrate/Sound" Button several times a day (I use it A LOT), well the iPhone just won`t sound at all, if you use Music it just muted, no matter how many times you press play/puse, stop, close all apps, turn switch to vibrate-sound  100times... if anoyone sent you a video through whatsapp it won`t sound, surfing the web: no sound, and so on... only fix: TURN OFF/ON your iphone... really??Another anyoning bug: Assistive touch function, I told you guys before that the screen is too big to use with only one hand, allright, iOs has this pretty cool function that shows a virtual HOME BUTTON into ur screen (I used it a lot in my last iPhone 5S), well you put this litte cool button in the middle left or right of the screen (to have it near of ur finger, right?) well, iOs just troll you and move it into the farest corner just to avoid you little finger to use it and have to use again: BOTH HANDS, ok you got me, where`s the hidden camera guys?...Another bug? iCloud control panel for windows sucks, iCloud photos stop sync (with PC or mac) when it wants, just simply dont work.Another one? Sometimes is just slow... with 5-10 apps openend or no one, iOs animation slows the use experience, even if you DISABLE animation in advance options...I`ve been using this iPhone6 for almost two months, and I`m not totally happy with it, its the more expensive phone I ever own, I wish I had for almost 1.000 bucks: the same coolest screen size, FASTER phone with a BRILLIANT iOS like it was in golden Apple years... this one its not the better I have owned.
Meet all expectations,Rodrigo Toro,5,Meet all expectations, works fine abroad. I'm using it in Ecuador, South America and works flawless. I give the seller five stars.
Five Stars,Ardeshir Bozorgmehr,5,its cool
Nothing to see here,jamie,3,I gave this phone 3 stars because Apple uses FoxCon boards, I think being a techie and knowing FoxCon makes low quality parts pushes me away from Iphone the. I have had a 3gs a I4, I5, and a I6, I end up usinga Samsung Galaxy line of phone.I am not a fan boy, I still favor BlackBerry,  but they lost me when they never moved on to touch screen, buy that time I moved on after years of loyalty.

another step on the ladder, but screen is a bit big,Run With Them Or Fear Them,4,bought it for friends who are apple fanatics and say the screen is better than ever- wouldn't trade up for the bigger screen even at the same price.  this one is a little bigger than the last iphone and if anything it's too big
I bought a golden 6 iphone, unlocked on 16 ...,Marina R,1,I bought a golden 6 iphone, unlocked on 16 December and brought to Brazil because I live here.Arriving had the unfortunate surprise to discover that it is LOCKED.Do not understand what happened because the specifications of the product and according to the almost $ 800 price was clear that this was an unlocked product.Now I have a cell blocked by AT & T operator, which does not work here in Brazil.I paid $ 800 for an unlocked cell phone while a locked cost me only 200.To unlock my phone here in Brazil I have to pay a fee, but I know of no reliable place to make it unlocked.I am very upset and dissatisfied with the product.
Five Stars,alex,5,Very fast and ligther than Iphone 5S.
Good but is great?,Bill Parkinson "Techboy",4,Like the bigger screen and very sleek but so sleek it can fall from your hand so be careful
but it was a very painful process. The migration doesn't work,Michael Karpa,2,I eventually got it to function, but it was a very painful process. The migration doesn't work. It is not compatible with older iPhones/macs. Tech support is unable to solve the problems. Be prepared to spend many hundreds of dollars on new peripherals, computers and software to get it to work. Also, after the latest iOS update, it no longer works with my car stereo.
Five Stars,nagib,5,Very Goood
***APPLE COULD DO BETTER BUT IT'S DEFINITELY THE BEST ON THE MARKET***,Branden M,4,Apple always surprises me but I know they have the tech to make the iphone better.

One of the best smartphones of 2014,Bryan the Great,5,One of the best smartphones of 2014. The dwonside is that it has an average battery life compared to other phones like Note 4.
Apple is quickly slipping. I hated using android because of glitches but this is no better. Poor screen resolution comparatively,Bogdan111,1,I was using the Galaxy s5 waiting for the iPhone 6 to come out because I hate android due to nothing but glitches on the android. Well, I don't know that the new iPhone is any better. It is beyond frustrating how a complacent industry titan pushes out mediocre products assuming customers will buy them because it's "Apple". The new iOS 8 is just unusable with the glitches. I cannot even begin to list the issues from freezing to force closes to the phone randomly making sounds when on silent. Aside from that the screen resolution is lacking considering all new android phone have a considerably higher pixel density. The fingerprint scanner is a joke and works I would say one third of the time having to keep retrying to unlock. Overall, after paying a premium for this product I could not be more unhappy.
Five Stars,Khalifa,5,Thanks
A wonderful phone, best iPhone yet!,John Egbert,5,I have always been an avid iPhone user, ever since the 3 was released. This one just takes the cake, by far surpassing all it's predecessors. I picked this phone up at target and from the moment I got it out of the box I was blown away. The screen size, I feel, fully unlocks the potential of iOS in general. It's really sharp and easy to see. The camera is amazing too, my favorite part is the built in slow-motion feature, which works flawlessly. It takes beautiful photos and videos. This phone is also exceptionally faster than all its predecessors, apps launching in record time. It's super sleek and wonderful and I couldn't be happier.The only problem I can really find is that sometimes when you have portrait lock on and open the camera, the gyro goes completely wonky and thinks that the iPhone is upside down, therefore resulting in upside down photos. I hope this will be fixed when I update my software today, but if not I just edit the image and flip it around.

Five Stars,Danielle Harmon,5,It a great product,thanks to appleExcellent .,Samuel Yagub,5,Very good.

Not in love,Arisa Bush,3,I was so excited to buy my first iPhone (I have the 6)... And well I definitely miss my GS5. I'm not saying iPhone isn't a good phone; it just isn't Amazing. It is fluid, solid; but basic. Great for older adults who aren't very tech savvy. I feel as though I switched from a Benz to a top of the line Toyota lol iTunes and the finger print scanner are awesome. I mean it's instant! Much better than S5. However; not many features for camera. No split screen for multi-tasking; which I used very much on my GS5. Email seems to have not progressed for Apple. I can compare because I've had iPads. It is just very generic. Sound quality while talking is a bit muffled. No option to decrease volume of touch sounds without decreasing volume of phone overall. These are things I've noticed after having this phone for 2 weeks. Maybe I'll learn to love it over the next 2 years.Three Stars,ernesto,3,just another iphone, but more expensive

Apple iPhone 6 Review by Gregg L. Friedman MD,Gregg L. Friedman MD,5,I love my Apple iPhone 6. It has many improvements over the iPhone 5. It is a wonderful phone and a must have for anyone who wants to best phone on the market. Apple has shown once again that they set the standard for the cell phone industry. I give the iPhone 6 a 5 Star Excellent rating. By Gregg L. Friedman MD
Four Stars,aymar giglio junior,4,Expensive but amazing.Disappointed and returned phone. Went back to using iphone5.,KendraM,2,I went from the iphone5 to the iphone6 and the only difference I noticed is the physical size of the phone being bigger (obviously) and the feature that allows the thumbprint to unlock phone without typing in the security code. Other than that there are no differences. I was really hoping the iPhone6 would be faster but that definitely did not happen. I was so disappointed that I returned the iphone6 and went back to iphone5. Maybe the next one will be better.
Amazing. 0.0,Ali Karim,5,This is the best smartphone i've owned in years. I've been an Apple collector since the IPhone (1st Generation) came out. Thank you Apple ;)

One Star,ognjen rondovic,1,Bulls***
Too pricey,Tanner Ostenson,2,To start, this phone is so overpriced. Apple has gotten to a point where they've drawn in all their customers and Apple knows they can't escape. Because of this, customers will pay basically anything short of their first born to buy this phone. The price can't even be explained by its features. As an example, Galaxy S5 has just about the same amount of features plus more (waterproof, auto-encryption, multiple users using Android L.)Also, the durability is also garbage. How often do you see an iPhone with a cracked screen? Almost every day! Galaxy products, to use the same example as before, are a lot more tough and durable. I've dropped my phone multiple times, yes I'm careless, and it doesn't have a scratch on it. This way, I don't have to waste MORE money on buying a case just to protect the said "smart glass."Overall, it's a high price for a cheap phone.

Five Stars,Gerson,5,Best Phone ever!!!Four Stars,John I Holahan,4,great phone

Five Stars,bruno,5,Yeahh
Way too fragile,Justin,1,I've been an iPhone guy since the beginning, but I'm pretty salty after my experience with the 6. In fact, I will probably never buy another iPhone. I dropped my 6 at most two feet after about three weeks of ownership. It landed on the back of the phone, yet somehow the glass shattered. I've had two friends with the same issue. Mind you, I should've bought a case. But what's the point of a "sleek" and "thin" phone if you have to put a bulky case on it to protect it? I've dropped my other iPhones from higher distances on harder surfaces with almost no damage (and no damage to the screen at all).Then, I bought a kit to fix it. I'm not much of a techy, but I broke down the phone to the last step (after hours of work...again because I'm slow) only to realize there is not way to fix the screen. The glass and touch screen panel are fused together. You cannot fix your phone without sending it back to Apple for a couple hundred bucks!!! Meanwhile, Droids are very easy to fix. I've seen it done a few times. It's as if Android cares about things like easy repairs whereas Apple wants you to fork out more money. I find this to go against everything the company used to stand for or at least what we were told Apple stands for - caring about the end user/customer.Anyhow, the phone is probably fine if you get a case right away. If not, be very careful with it because the slightest knock off a table will likely crack the glass.Oh and Apple won't care about your issue. They've cornered the market in the US, so an unhappy customer here and there doesn't matter. Not when they can keep running those same commercials over and over again about how great it is.
Where's the 160 gb iPod Classic?,Jonathan Scott "Songe",1,Where's the 160 gb iPod Classic?  You took away the best and replaced it with high-priced silliness.
Overpriced,Bill,4,These phones are upwards of 100-200 dollars cheaper at Best Buy and the Apple Store.
Five Stars,shadia watrud,5,Very good
Nothing much has changed about the iPhone,tonya,2,Nothing much has changed about the iPhone, other than this one won't fit in your pocket. That's the "bigger and better" part of it. It's gorgeous without a case but too risky! Won't be an iPhone until the screen cracks. It'll shatter your hopes, dreams, and regret not insuring it on top of how expensive it is. The camera is amazing, you'll feel like a photographer. However, the new photo and video attachment feature can be your worst nightmare; you have no privacy. Oh, and have fun with the new iOS8 feature! The new iPhone 6 serves for those looking to spend.
Five Stars,Ismail Mbabali,5,loved it.
Five Stars,ziyad,5,excelent
Both deisgn and quality of the iPhone have suffered significantly over the years (the quality of the glass is so poor it scratch,typically lenient,1,Previously I owned an iPhone 4 and an iPad 2. These were my first ventures into the apple world. They were both marvels of design and engineering. So much so I was considering a switch to a Mac for my computing needs. I skipped the iPhone 5 but thought it about time to upgrade when 6 became avaialable. Having it now for 2 months I would rename it iCrap6. Both deisgn and quality of the iPhone have suffered significantly over the years (the quality of the glass is so poor it scratches if you stare at it).  This convinced me not to upgrade the iPad so I installed iOS 8. Another mistake.  My old iPad has never worked so poorly.  As for moving to a Mac, the idea has completely disappeared from my head. It seems the philosophy of Apple has also disappeared from the corporate psyche.
Five Stars,Juan Pablo Esteban,5,It works very good in Colombia . Best smart phone in the market
100$ more than Apple Store?,sharan,1,What's the difference between this phone and the one sold from Apple? Apple Says 1 month contract needed from T-Mobile but it's not needed, we can use any network. Apple Store full price phones are unlocked. You are paying 700$ in Apple I'm not convinced why we need to pay $800 here
amazing price. Love the product,Michaela,5,Fast shipping, unlock, new, amazing price. Love the product!! I would definitely recommend this seller and his products!
Sorry?,gidolgibor,4,I have given all previous iPhones 6 stars but not this one.Pros:1. Operating system is fast and easy to use2. The camera and its features are unparalleled3. Battery life is very long. A full charge will last me full day and a halfCons:1. The phone's construction and materials are subpar. First time ever2. The speakers are poor3.

Apple fans, try a different phone and see what you are missing,YZ,1,I'll never buy another iPhone until Apple adds a "BACK" button.I've owned iPhones and Android phones. While a lot can be said of the nice features of iPhone, the lack of a "Back" button shows how stupidly arrogant Apple is and how it's sacrificing user experience for its bloated ego. Android and Windows mobile operating systems both have the "Back" button for a reason - the Back button is the easiest, most often used and most natural way to navigate in almost all apps. Apply doesn't add this function for no other reason than it doesn't want to admit it needs to learn a thing or two from others. There is Back button in iPhone Safari browser and some other apps, but each app may have this function at a different location, so users have to look for it each time. A Back button built into the operating system as in Android and Windows is obviously more convenient and natural. But Apple's ego is too large to go "Back" to fix this issue. Again, that's STUPIDLY arrogant. I'll never buy another Apply product until it learns a little modesty and make its product better for customers, not its ego!- Update in response to a comment from another user on my reviewThe user (obviously an Apple fan) said that all iPhone apps have some sort of "Back" function tied to the iOS navigation requirement. But that's exactly the problem. Each app builds the "Back" function differently, and the location varies from app to app. In Android and Windows, the Back button is always conveniently at the bottom of the phone, so one-hand operation is easy and natural. But on iPhone, even before the larger iPhone 6, it's almost impossible to easily navigate with one hand. And one simple touch to go "Back" in Android and Windows usually requires two or more moves. The really sad thing about iPhone is a commercial product turned into a religion. Apple fans blindly follow it without any rational thinking. I'm definitely not saying Android is perfect, but if Apple can't add a convenient, natural navigation function (which is obviously easy for it to do), it says something about its mentality. Apple fans may feel proud of all the tricks in navigating iPhone, but isn't iOS supposed to be the most intuitive and simple to use? Think of another difference between iPhone and Android phones. In Android, users can either set display brightness to "auto", or manually adjust it. In iPhone, iOS automatically adjusts the brightness, users have no choice. Apple fans would say iOS makes it simple so users don't need to adjust it. Android also has the default "auto" feature so users don't need to adjust it. But the difference is Android gives users the choice just in case users need to. And you know what? The universe has so many possibilities that some time the auto brightness doesn't fit a particular situation! Apple regards itself to be the master of the universe, while Android and Windows know there are limitations to whatever geniuses can foresee.All I'm trying to say is, if you love iPhone, love it rationally, at least look what's out there in the wider world and make an informed decision.
Recommend!,Grazvydas,5,I love it!
Iphone 6 Pro's and Con's,daniel,4,I recently  bought the iphone 6 gold and it has both Pro's and Con's .Pro's: *Bigger screen makes it more comfortable to use*Camera is substantially better than previous Iphone*Speaker are also a lot louder.Con's : *Earbud jack does not go all the way in and falls out a lot which makes it hard to listen to music.*Some times apps shutdown randomly.Overall I would recommend buying this phone.

The once innovative iPhone is falling behind the times!,Boss,1,I don't own the iPhone 6 but did throughly test it out in store for several hours. I currently happily own a 15" top of the line Retina Macbook Pro and previously owned the original iPhone, 3gs, and iPhone 4 before switching to Android with the Nexus 4.While the Nexus 4 served me quite well and could have much longer, I decided to look into & test all of the latest new phones on the market, including the iPhone 6, before deciding to buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 which so far I think is really awesome!I think the Note 4 is the best phone I've ever owned and I don't miss the closed enviroment of the iPhone, requiring frequent jailbreaks if you want to break out of the jailed environment, but even worse in my opinion is the iPhone 6 comes with just 1GB of RAM!Even my 2 year old Nexus 4 had 2GB of RAM and my new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 comes with a whopping 3GB of RAM, with expandable storage of up to an extra 128GB via a micro-sd card, making it easy to store more files and play that data with ease!While the iPhone 6 will serve those who want a pretty phone or the technology challenged well (who still may use a VCR that flashes 12:00 all the time), but for anyone who wants a powerful phone that's not 2 years behind you should buy a better phone!

iPhone 6 is The Best iPhone Apple Have Ever Released,James Thomas,5,So let’s get down to what matters right? Specs, specs and more specs! Plus what’s new and why we should even think about upgrading from our iPhone 5s.1: Size: The dimensions and weight of course matter; unless you don’t mind carrying around a brick the size of trailer. The iPhone 6 comes in at 5.44 x 2.64 x 0.27 inches & weighing in at 4.55 oz. which of course is a bit larger than my 5s. This should help out some of us with slightly larger hands, but still have a nice grip and feel for all around daily use, ease of navigation and just general accessibility.2: RETINA HD DISPLAY: Having shatter proof glass is definitely necessary, unless you plan on keeping your iPhone 6 in the retail box- never holding it and making phone calls on speaker phone for the rest of your life. Yes, it’s upgraded from my old 5s Retina display to the RETINA HD DISPLAY! So why is it better you ask? With a Retina HD display, you better know the screen is delivering higher contrast and way better color accuracy, which all plays out as just an all around incredible display. Not to mention a bigger screen at 4.7’’ vs my iPhone 5’s 4.0’’ and higher resolution compared to the 5s, with the 750 x1334 (750p resolution) and a 1400 contrast ratio. Another added feature that is pretty slick is the dual-domain pixels for wider viewing angles, so when I’m showing my friend something, I don’t have to have to reach out and aim my phone directly in front of their face.3: NFC support: Now apparently we will only be able to use NFC capabilities with Apple pay for now, which allows me to make touch-less payments in stores and stuff, which I think is incredibly cool and futuristic. Now I know some will complain as to why all the capabilities aren’t functional, and no one truly knows except for Apple, but apparently the particular NFC chip has more capabilities beyond just Apple Pay. Apparently at an Apple event, the watch unlocked a hotel room, so I guess these are just some of the possibilities that this particular NFC chipset holds. So even though I have to wait a bit to use the NFC fully, I’m sure the wait will be well worth it in the long run.4: Speed: Using the Apple A8 chipset and a Dual Core 1.4 GHz Cyclone, compared to the iPhone 5’s 1.3 Ghz, we’re getting a speed boost to keep up with multi-tasking and if you’re like me constantly on your phone, working, gaming, and texting and have 100 apps open at the same time, then you know how much speed is a factor. Since it’s using the A8 chipset, this literally allows for 50% increased performance for graphics and 25% faster processing.5: Battery: The new battery on iPhone 6 is 50% more efficient. Though I haven’t run it through extreme testing as of yet, I’m already noticing a difference right out of the box and playing with it for a few hours.6: Camera: The new iSight camera is upgraded using a 8MP camera at 1.5µ pixels and 2.2 aperture. Although it doesn’t come with Optical Image stabilization like the Plus does, it’s still definitely worth the upgrades that are provided on the 4.7’’.A few others feature’s worth mentioning:Support for 3rd-party keyboards – This is elaborated on below (so check out the rest of my review under Quicktype keyboards)Improved face detection on iSight Camera - Which recognizes faces incredibly faster, while improving smile and blink detecting for overall better photos of you and with friends. I haven’t had a chance to take it with a group to test it yet, but at least it’s got this cool feature either way.Improved HDR photos and videos – The few new photos I’ve already taken have a noticeable difference compared to my 5S. I put them side by side to test and if I can notice the difference at a quick glance, then I’m happy with the upgrade and improvementsImproved video recording at 1080p @ 60 fps – Doing slo-mo is kind of funny just for messing around. I’ve only tested one video with our Cat on his “catnip” running around the house and rolling around on the floor and it definitely gave us a good laugh. The real thing I’m interested in but haven’t tested yet is the time-lapse video, being able to catch a sunset or moon rising within a few seconds on video is probably one of the coolest features for editing later or just making fun videos.Cloud Photo backup pricing varies – I get up to 5GB free, which is more than enough for me with photos and a few videos I want to keep around for a bit. If I ever need to upgrade the pricing below gets me more space on the backup.20 GB 99 cents per month200 GB $3.99 per month500 GB @ $9.99 per month-1 TB @ $19.99 per monthBeyond all the specs of the 6, there’s always that question…. “Why do I use an iPhone ?Performance on the iPhone has always been a major factor. The iOS system consistency offers stellar performance and rarely ever experiences major performance issues. Now with the iOS 8 update that happened on 9/17, which is expanding features and finally giving us more functionality. Some of these key features are a nice addition to my daily use.-Messages: The fact I can now easily share my location with my girl or friends, when we want to meet up somewhere is sweet. Plus it giving me the ability to add a video instantly to my messages makes this a super cool feature-Sharing with family: Now I can share the stuff I’ve purchased from iTunes or even the app store with family. Some of the app’s I’ve paid for are relatively expensive, and when my brother likes one of the apps, instead of him having to buy it, I can just share it with him! I think this is pretty generous on Apples part, allowing me use this with my fam.-Interactive Notifications: Which is now allowing us to swipe our iMessage or text message notifications to open them quickly and reply instantly back. Now I don’t have to open or leave the app, which was kind of annoying at times. I want things on the go and on the fly and I’m glad this new feature was added.-Quicktype Keyboard: Even though the iOS 8 update improved the keyboard functionality, it is now allowing for 3rd party keyboards to be used. The word prediction is also another nice update, which should help us out with the darn auto-correct problems. Though the update has fixed most of the auto-correct problems, it’s still better having more options than none.-Adding extensions: This is something that definitely helps me keep things going when I need to check for updates on the fly. The widgets and extensions aren’t limited anymore, since the iOS 8 update has now expanded to online services! They will sit only in the notification center, but this helps with unnecessary battery drain and extra mess on my screen.-Photo editing: I can now edit and or update my photos directly from Camera roll once I’ve snapped a picture, instead of having to enter into VSCO Cam. That used to annoy me, because I wanted to just snap a photo, edit it and send it quickly. Now with this new feature it’s finally possible and makes life easier if you’re a “food picture” taking freak like me.-The Continuity feature: This is something I’m seriously looking forward to. Basically the integration with my Mac or tablet will allow me to answer phone calls on either, or even answer text instead of having to pick up my iPhone. From what I hear, I can literally swipe documents from my phone or iPad directly to a computer or vice versa. My Mac is connected to my TV, so if I can literally swipe my Netflix app onto my Mac which is connected to the TV while I’m on the couch, then this function is seriously freaking cool.In a long story short. I love my iPhone 6 and with the ease of use, literally being able to do everything with one hand, the iPhones durability and with the hugest assortment of apps on the market. I don’t really have any complaints as of now, besides some small ones that are going to get fixed anyway. Even if I do have an issue, their grade A+ customer service is always there to help me out as quickly as they can.Overall… with my new iPhone 6 and the update to the iOS 8 it’s a serious upgrade and with the iOS system in general you know it’s going to be stable, which is why we even use iPhone in the first place!

Buy Applecare,J. Patrick Cronin "PC Man",3,The new size provides an amazing easier screen to read especially for someone like me with glasses. I find myself squinting less and actually using my phone to read and resound to email instead of opening up my mac. The video editing and integration with the mac make life easy. I can text, talk, or FaceTime on my mac close it down in the middle of a conversation and continue that conversation on my iPhone.Beware that the out of warranty price at the writing of this review is $299 for the iPhone should the screen crack. I searched around for a cheaper alternative when my son's phone dropped and shattered in the first week. The cheapest non-apple alternative I could find was $330 because the part alone is nearly $300. I was surprised that by merely falling out of a pocket the phone looked like it exploded. We've had iPhone 4, 4s, and 5s where they fell and the screen cracked (and more times where no crack showed). For whatever reason, the iPhone 6 seems extremely fragile. The guys at apple were understanding but admitted that they're seeing a lot more come in with damage than prior models.Real value == $400,Hil,1,Quite a few people like to show off their iPhone 6 as a symbol of status. Apple has created such a brand with last year's technologies to lure people. While Samsung, LG, Motorola and other top Android manufacturers are pushing the limit of smart phone technologies, Apple has lagged behind for 1 year on the hardware front and 2 years on the software front with Google. I wrote another review regarding the camera comparison between iPhone 6, 6+, and LG G3. The photo samples are at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-mVIvj6SluAM0YzRGNZT0g5Snc&usp=sharing. While iPhone 6 and 6+'s camera has done better in the low light than LG G3, iPhone 6's camera captured completely blurred license plate numbers compared to the other 2 phones. That was embarrassing losing so much details. Samsung Galaxy S5 might have a better chance winning the low light test with iPhone 6 but the mountain picture shows the lack of details on the trees from iPhone 6's camera compared to LG G3's. I was able to see the differences from the phones and have another hiker who owned iPhone 6+ to verify them. The differences are more obvious if viewed on PC with large monitors. Not everything is bad about the camera, iPhone 6's camera actually did well capturing text in low light. Check the picture that has a yellow Chinese book. Zoom in and you'd see the text more clear than LG G3's. The file names tell you which picture belongs to which device. On the software side, Apple finally allow accessing iCloud data via iCloud Drive following what Google did years back. So it's playing catchup. However, my test of iCloud backup failed intermittently. Most of the iOS 8 features are following Google's Android 4.4 or barely matching it. Some people may think having a fingerprint sensor makes the device more secure. Definitely not. If fingerprint unlock fails, it reverts to PIN unlock. Anyone who knows possible PIN numbers can unlock your iPhone 6 by bypassing the fingerprint unlock screen. I found this because the fingerprint unlock worked 45% of the time on me. What could be more embarrassing if you use Apple pay but fails. I will for sure be the customer in line next to the failed Apple pay user yelling "get out, there are more people behind me trying to checkout". There are a few design decisions that make iOS 8 quite annoying. The most is mandatory password entry installing free apps. Android does not require that. One reason I can think of may be Apple does not want user to forget Apple ID's password. I've seen Android users fail to remember its Gmail password. Those dump ones are not using Google's string service back end and are usually the victims of converting to buying iPhones. The other less annoying design decision is that it requires user touching OK for "[App] would like to access your [location/photo/etc…]". I had to touch OK at every prompt. I can't think of practical uses of not allowing the app to do its functionality. If you don't trust the app, maybe you should not have downloaded it. I've seen a user choosing not allow for Google search/maps resulting in find a Starbucks 1000 miles away (useless search result). The user was misled that someone was trying to snoop on her. Android takes a different approach showing users the access permissions at app download time. Which eliminates the needs to asking users for permission at each turn. I believe the true price for iPhone 6 should be $400, not $650. The screen to body ratio is another sign of inferior hardware engineering. The top part of the phone from the edge of the screen to the top end measured in length is wider than LG G3. Such length is even wide on iPhone 6+. Apple should have pushed the screen edge to the top end  of the phone. Such tiny space could only allow putting a speaker and a front camera. LG G2, G3 did it. But Apple failed. Remember Apple bought the IPS LCD screen from LG and have Foxconn assemble it. The pixel resolution for iPhone 6 is 720p, 6+: 1080p, LG G3: 1440p

I wish it was slightly bigger, but the 6 Plus is too big.,Dust Storm (aka Haboob),5,This review is for the iPhone 6 (4.7”) phone. I bought my iPhone through Apple and it is not the unlocked version (it is tied to AT&T), so I am just reviewing the phone itself.First of all, I have owned every iPhone since the 3G. I currently am using the iPhone 6 Plus, but my wife has the iPhone 6 and I use it extensively also.I bought the iPhone 6 Plus and 6 on launch day. I did extensive research and comparing different factors to make the decision of which iPhone to buy. Like I mentioned, I personally chose the iPhone 6 Plus and knowing what I know now, I wish I would have bought the iPhone 6.The iPhone is noticeably larger than the iPhone 5/5s, both wider and taller. It is also significantly and noticeably thinner. As you can read and tell from photos, the design of the body is also completely different with the iPhone 6. Another major difference this year is the read camera actually protrudes from the back of the phone. This is because the phone is so thin, the camera components literally could not fit within the thickness of the phone body. I personally do not mind this because I have a case on my iPhone 6. But, if you do not have a case, then you will notice the phone "wobble" when it is on a flat surface. Although the lens is also made of sapphire, you do run the risk of scratching or damaging this camera if you are not careful.The rest of the features, such as speed, graphics, display, etc., is all incremental from the iPhone 5s and its not THAT noticeable. In fact, I actually have an iPhone 5s as a work phone, and I have compared it to the iPhone 6 by opening the same apps, loading the same webpages, etc., and occasionally the 5s actually beats the iPhone 6.My wife and I are heavy photo users with the iPhone 6, and one thing that you can tell is better is the picture quality with the iPhone 6. Additionally, the call quality and sound is definitely noticeable both from your end, and the person who you are calling (the first phone call we made on the iPhone 6 was to my mom, and she said "what are you calling me from? You sound so much clearer than normal."If you have a family or just naturally take a lot of photos, I would recommend that you upgrade to the 128gb model. Because the photo quality is better, the file size is larger so it takes up more space. Add in music, movies, and apps, you can run out of space quickly.Ultimately, the iPhone 6 is the most amazing iPhone yet and you definitely will not be sorry you purchased it. If you are torn between the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, I honestly would recommend the 6. I am a 280b, 5'11" man, and I think the iPhone 6 Plus is just too massive for your hand, pockets, etc.
Five Stars,Steve,5,I love the camera on this thing. The slow motion is really smooth. Here's a sample: http://youtu.be/NojspTnbRAo
Five Stars,Jesus Jimenez,5,all good Excellent Product!!
16 GB in 2014?,mph,1,This would have been a great phone, had Apple not been so stingy on the memory. This is 2014. Memory is so cheap - you can get a 64 GB micro SD card for under $30 - the base model of this phone should be 64, NOT 16 GB. 16 gigs is essentially enough only for the operating system and a hand full of photos and apps, not enough for a music library. Just an underhanded way for Apple to squeeze more money out of consumers.

Excellent,vegan f.,5,ExcellentFive Stars,eduardo,5,Ok

I've never had a iPhone,JJ,1,I have never own I anythig. I guess the die hard iPhone  zombies cannot unplug themselves long enough to see that their are actually wayyyyyy better phones out there. I for one have always been an android phone user myself always been pretty impressed. I notice on commercials when iPhone say they have the all new and voice activated blah blah. Well guess what my Samsung has done all that and more at least 6 months to a year before iphone. Ok thanks for reading my rant. Now try reading this again in a British accent.  Sounds way cooler
Needs sturdier design,joanie crawford,3,I love iPhones. If your buying this without a contract, I think the price point is high. It has upgraded technology from the previous phones. It works great. I just feel as though the design and durability of the casing. It seems like it would bend easily and the glass would pop out. It is very delicate and I'm disappointed in the construction of it. That's where it is lacking. It needs a sturdier design and then it would be a top notch phone. Apple should work on this for the future.
